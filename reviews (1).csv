EASWAR52,Jun-23,Charminar,3,Family,"Historical CHARMINAR is the centre of attraction in Hyderabad. It is located in the midst of buzzing bazars. It is a simple structure containing four minarets. There are there are stairs with narrow & steep steps. In the upper floor one can see archways leading to balconies overlooking all four sides. These balconies provide beautiful views. Local culture is visible from the structure. The structure loses its worth due to the poor maintenance. In view of the steepness of the steps older people & those with knee issues will have difficulty in climbing the stairs. Though it is treated as a mosque it doesn‚Äôt look like one. Congested location makes the visit all the more difficult. One can visit here only to cherish the history and the view from here. 
"
Mr. Himanshu Sinha,Jan-23,Charminar,5,Solo,"Charminar is now getting too much filled with people, it's always very busy, and no proper management team is there. people are fighting over and over to reach a certain place, The stairs are very very steep if you want to climb to the top, the view is like, you are watching people everywhere. wherever your eyes turn you will see the crowd. Many staircases are closed due to maintenance, many rooms are closed, yes it's a famous spot in Hyderabad other than that I will not say it is a must-visit."
fudxplorer,Dec-22,Charminar,5,Friends,A fantastic structure. Ab it crowded as we went on a weekend. Also we climbed up to the top of it. Steps are steep and bit congested while climbing and getting down.
sanjib c,May-23,Charminar,3,,"Good historical place to visit but too crowded. The place needs to be be maintained by the authorities for cleanliness as the locals, hawkers, shops and the tourists litter the place with disposals. People over there should be advised and fines to be imposed on breaking the rules. It is a pity that such a beautiful historic place is not maintained. One should not forget to have the falooda and lassi nearby. Shopping for glass bangles is a must for the ladies. "
Roving04785576285,Apr-23,Charminar,4,Solo,"Hyderabad is a lively, vibrant city with great infrastructure, lot of greenery, lip smacking food and good roads. It's a little expensive though in terms of transport and cost of living, of course not expensive than Bengaluru but definitely a notch up than delhi and some other cities. not a lot of places to visit also, just Charminar, Hussain Sagar lake, Golconda fort and a few other popular ones. if you are looking for weekend getaways, you will have to either go towards Karnataka or Andhra or tamil nadu side. overall, you can spend a good two days in Hyderabad, roaming around and soaking the city, having delicious food! "
Najeeb Ahmad,Feb-23,Charminar,5,Family,"Charminar is an iconic monument located in the heart of Hyderabad, India. It is a famous tourist attraction that draws visitors from all over the world. The monument was built in 1591 and has since become a symbol of the city's rich history and culture. 
The structure is a beautiful example of Islamic architecture, with four minarets that rise to a height of 56 meters. The monument is surrounded by a bustling market known as Laad Bazaar, where visitors can shop for traditional clothing, jewelry, and handicrafts. 
Charminar is well-maintained and provides a range of facilities to visitors, including audio guides, restrooms, and drinking water facilities. The monument's interior is not open to visitors, but the stunning exterior is a sight to behold. The area around Charminar is vibrant and lively, with street food stalls selling delicious local delicacies. Visitors can also explore the nearby historical landmarks such as the Mecca Masjid and the Chowmahalla Palace. 
The monument is open to visitors from 9:30 am to 5:30 pm every day, and there is a small entrance fee for non-Indian visitors. 
Overall, Charminar is a must-visit tourist destination that showcases the rich cultural heritage of Hyderabad. The monument's stunning architecture and the bustling market around it make for a memorable experience for visitors. ----------------------- ‚úçÔ∏èüì∏mr_najeeb_07 "
W S,Jan-23,Charminar,4,Solo,"It is the epicentre of Hyderabad. Where it all started. It is well worth the visit. I had a tour guide so that I could understand about the building and local points of interest. 
What disappointed me (although I have now seen this frequently on my travels) is that there is one fee for residents and I think is was a 25 times increase of the price for foreigners. As said this now seems the norm. I understand the reason but I had never seen this before in any country that I had been too so was suprised. That being said, it is a major landmark and I would recommend a visit and if possible get a tour guide. It does get busy there. "

bhaskara,Mar-23,Charminar,3,,"A very crowded place with roadside shops. Also, the issue with beggars, they simply touch you and don't leave until you Pay. Avoid going there on Weekends or festival times. Be careful with your mobile and money. No proper maintenance and respect for tourists in this area. 
The view is good from inside and outside Charminar. The only issue is no maintenance and officials seem to get used to it, so they don't care about beggars and robbers who are troubling travelers. 
Use only Ola or Uber if you are traveling alone or with family. Autowala charges double the cost here. 
Old age people, avoid climbing Charminar. The steps are very deep and the width is very small. They will inform you only at the entry, so you may lose money if you decide not to climb after purchasing tickets. "
Journeyscribe,Dec-22,Charminar,5,,"A piece of history, excellent architecture. Avoid bring your own cars as parking facility is a mess. "
srinivasan s,Dec-22,Charminar,4,Family,"The steps of the charminar are steep.. otherwise it's worth visiting.. around Charminar you can do shopping especially bangles.. better visit in the afternoon it will be less crowded..no car parking available..plan accordingly

Rahul2604,Jan-23,Charminar,3,Solo,"Disappointed, Landmark of Hyderabad still not well maintained,expected something better,also the area surrounding is full of street vendors,not saying that everyone should be removed but at least make a 10-20 m buffer zone surrounding the Charminar,vendors are as close as they can from the monument,not an pleasant experience for tourists when they are here to explore Charminar. The area around the monument is just like any old city area in India eg Old Delhi/Chandani Chowk,congested,crowded but full of life,lively,many legendary restaurants to enjoy,also this area is famous for pearls and pearls jewelry. During Ramazan worth to visit in evening/night if you are a foodie. "
Saurabh M,Dec-22,Charminar,4,Friends,"
Exploring Telangana....... Hyderabad......at Chairminar........Best way to reach is get down at MGBS metro station and take bus or auto..... Or directly auto from anywhere.... 
An identifying feature of the city, Charminar is the most prominent landmark located right in the heart of Hyderabad. The monument was erected by Quli Qutub Shah to signify the founding of Hyderabad. As is evident from the structure, it was so named as it consists of four minarets. Although it lies right in the centre of the city with traffic and crowds milling all about it, Charminar certainly manages to hold the gaze. It is also famous for the market that sprawls around it and is called 'Laad' or 'Chudi' Bazaar. 
Since the construction of the monument in 1591, Charminar has been synonymous with the culture of Hyderabad standing tall as a reminder of the glorious days of the past era. It is a massive structure which has four minarets which many believe stand for the first four 'khalifas' (Prophets) of Islam. Towards the north of the monument, there are four gateways known as Char Kaman which have been constructed in the cardinal directions. The structure was intended to serve as a Madrasa or a Mosque. In its present form, Charminar, has been added to the 'tentative list' of UNESCO World Heritage Sites. 
The structure of Charminar is an exquisite example of Indo-Islamic architecture with Persian influences. The arches and domes of the monument define the influence of Islamic architecture, while the Persian influence is prominent from its minarets. The balconies and the outside walls, embellished with delicate stucco floral ornamentations on the ceiling, showcases the influence of the Hindu style of architecture.At the base of the Charminar is a small temple called as ""Bhagyalakshmi Temple"".... 
The Charminar was built to commemorate the decision and eradication of plague from the city. It is known as Charminar as it is supported by four minarets on four sides which were possibly meant to commemorate the first four caliphs of Islam. The old city of Hyderabad was designed keeping Charminar as the centre of the city. 
According to some legends, Quli Qutub Shahi saw his beloved wife, Baghmati, at this very site. He built Charminar as a symbol of his eternal love for his wife. There is also a legend that talks about the existence of a secret tunnel under the Charminar that connects it to the Golkonda Fort. It was created as a means of escape for the royal family in the time of emergencies. 
Charminar is famous for many things but is most known for the lip smacking dishes and great bargain shopping. There is no better place for shopping in Hyderabad than the area surrounding the Charminar. The streets are brimming with people at all times, with the shops displaying attractive and colourful bangles and jewellery. It is popular for bangles, pearls, jewellery, semi-precious stones, silverware, Kalamkari paintings, sarees, silk materials, gold embroidered fabric, lacquer bangles, ittar and the traditional Khara dupatta. This street is filled with people and haggling is part and parcel of this market..... "
jojo,Dec-22,Charminar,4,,"Of much historical importance the monument was crowded when we visited. It was properly maintained but the surrounding areas needed proper control.Being the lanmark of Hydrabad attractd visitors. Area near parking was not properly kept neat and clean.. The area was famous for shopping. especially clothing,, novelties, artificial jewelleries, domestic items etc. Bargaining was must. The people around were very cordial and friendly. Rather congested area more attenton was required.. The evironment of festival making happy especially the kids."
Xavier D,Dec-22,Charminar,4,,Charminar is symbol of Hyderabad for rest of the country as well as for the world. Unfortunately during my visit it was very highly crowded.
vasant agshikar,Dec-22,Charminar,5,Couples,"Best time to visit charminar by 9 am if you wanna enjoy the view without hustle bustle. You can click some pics too and observe the ancient monument. Evening time visit has its own charm as the crowded with full of people and lively market. One can do local shopping of bangles, pearls and other stuff"
Gurutej,Nov-22,Charminar,3,Family,"Nothing very special here. To be visited only because it is the landmark of Hyderabad. 
The parking area is almost non-existent, and the place is fully congested. "
Raman G,Nov-22,Charminar,4,Couples,Went in the afternoon. We walked in 5 minutes to this place from Chowmullah Palace. A visit only because it is popular. And has been advertised a lot. The area around is dirty and crowded with hawkers. The latter keep pestering. The segregated area around it has hawker stalls which is a pain for a tourist. It could have been developed beautifully. One is allowed to climb up to the first floor. We did not do so.
OctOriental,Nov-22,Charminar,3,,"Touted as a hallmark of Hyderabad. But it's a risky, unenjoyable and terribly congested place with a million or so hawkers cluttering up the place and rendering it unworthy of your time and effort. The least the administration could have done is clear up the central area at least to afford a good view of the Charminar."
Chandra J,Oct-22,Charminar,3,Friends,"Incredibly busy, hard to walk. Good chai tea bakery right near monument. Went during Diwali so it might have been busier than usual. Couldn't get up close."
stevebintley,Oct-22,Charminar,5,,"What a place! This is a must visit for anyone in the city and the colours and atmosphere in an evening are superb. I‚Äôm reliably informed that weekends are particularly busy, and given the number of people on the mid-week day I visited I‚Äôd encourage to avoid too, but it‚Äôs well worth battling the crowds to get into the centre of the action. There‚Äôs so many market sellers although none are too pushy, live performances and a generally friendly vibe. The history is great, so many good photo opportunities and a real insight into the local culture. Highly recommended!"
Mohan D,Nov-22,Charminar,4,Family,Very good place to see but we have to take from howker as it surrounded by them. Maintain properly but expect more to maintain properly neet and clen 
Global-Bhatakanti,Nov-22,Charminar,3,Family,"Historical moment inspired by do minar from Gowalkonda Fort. No parking nearby. One has to park car in chowmohalla palace. Street Market area around Charminar. Can be covered as day sightseeing tour along with Chowmahalla Palace, Salarjung Museum and shopping "

Shafeeq T,Aug-22,Charminar,4,Friends,"""Great place for variety of shopping at affordable price and street food."" One of the most loved monuments in Hyderabad. Loads of people around the world do come to visit it"
Sundaresh,Sep-22,Charminar,5,,"The best place for trying authentic Nawab cuisine, pearls, dress, slippers, bangles, Tea, samosa, kababs, tourist attractions, holy places of worship. "
DrQuresh M,Sep-22,Charminar,1,Friends,We drove there hoping to explore the historical site . However we changed our minds as a little rain had rendered the area slushy. The approach area was very congested and filthy
Vaishnavi_g,Sep-22,Charminar,2,,"Charminar looks well maintained from outside. Impressive structure. But not worth going in and climbing up. Interiors are not well maintained. You get pigeon smell. I guess the whole hype around charminar is for the huge flee markets and other shopping areas around it. Where you you can shop just everything from clothes, pearls, bangles and other collectibles. Otherwise you can just watch this on postcard. Not worth investing time. "
Sajid,Aug-22,Charminar,4,,"The building, the structure is awe-inspiring and to think that it stands there for more than 4 centuries is amazing. What disappoints though is the fact that like most of the places in India, this monument is also not being maintained properly. I fail to understand, why do we find it so difficult to maintain our heritage. This is such an amazing piece of architecture, yet the neglect from authorities is glaring."
Krishna,Jul-22,Charminar,1,Family,"Not a great place to visit. 
I don‚Äôt recommend it for visiting especially for families. Not a good place for visiting "

salony s,Mar-22,Charminar,3,Couples,The monument is worth visiting as it‚Äôs beautiful but it‚Äôs super crowded. The best part is the market around Charminar.
Pradip Kumar Roy Choudhury,Feb-22,Charminar,3,Couples,"Not worth going,simply because the crowd and the jostling around.You don't really get to see and appreciate the architecture creation.But visit the area for Pearl shopping etc etc"
Madan R,Feb-22,Charminar,5,Solo,Nice place. Nice people. Historical place. All leaving in harmony. Shadab Biryani is good to try and can shop around in the market.
BharathiMani,Mar-22,Charminar,5,Couples,A nice place to go in the evening to go and hang out. Soak in the ambience and enjoy a chai with biscuit. It's in a market area.
MLGP2015,Feb-22,Charminar,5,,"One of the oldest buildings in India. Surrounded by a crowded, fun market where both locals and tourists shop."
Dr RAJKUMAR YADAV,Feb-22,Charminar,5,Family,At least government should feel shame that they somehow forget its historical and they should try to save the glory of the nation
Milind Kshirsagar,Jan-22,Charminar,4,Family,Symbol of Hyderabad. Must visit. But don't expect too much. Not an architectural marvel. But surrounding bazar is awesome.
Avirup Guha Roy,Jan-21,Charminar,5,,"Commissioned by Md. Quli Qutb Shah in 1591, this was built to commemmorate the end of plague epidemic... the four minarets depict the first four Caliphs of Islam... the Monument was built in granite and lime mortar using Cazia style of architecture"
Amina,Dec-21,Charminar,5,Friends,Charminar is one of the best popular tourist attractions in Hyderabad.. The charminar thought nothing much to do there .. The mousqe is very beautiful and peaceful place to seat and relax your mind but out side is very crowded with small vendors.. Best place to do shopping for ladies.. Remember if you want to buy something bargain or else you will loose your money.. Bangles and Pearls are very famous here.. Don't forget to try Hyderabad world famous Paradise Biryani and Irani chai..

Raja vishnu vardhan Reddy (visrey),Sep-21,Charminar,5,,Seeing Charminar in a normal time is just like attending a fair with thousands of people bustling without even inch space. Best way to see Charminar without the crowd is visiting it after 12 though you can't actually enter inside charminar late night but it's a good measure to avoid crowd because of the covid and you can see no one wearing a mask in your vicinity if you are there in normal times.
Nilesh A,Aug-21,Charminar,4,Family,"One of the iconic monument of India, well maintained from out side. Enjoyed the day , must visit the market."
Manoj Kumar,Jul-21,Charminar,5,Friends,"It is a wonderful place to visit. It was amazing, and the narrow passage were incredible. It was still under maintenance when I visited it. The charges for Indians were Rs. 20. There are many shops in the area, from antique shops to new. Shopping is all about bargaining. Street food is heaven. You will enjoy the views if you visit at night. "
abizer p,Aug-21,Charminar,4,Couples,Anlandmark of the city. The views from top are great. One can take great pictures from top. The climb is interesting as well as exhausting.  Some good architecture and writingson the walls . Its a must visit. A bit run down. Ammonia odour on the steps which go down. Authorities must lok into that. 
Anjana,Jul-21,Charminar,1,Friends,A complete Shame‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ the heritage site has become a cheap shopping lane . I was heartbroken to c the place. I had been here a few years ago n had fond memories but the current visit washed up all the memories‚Ä¶.. wake up Government and plz save the place
dr ganapathi bhat,Jul-21,Charminar,4,Family,"The name is do big that no visitor to Hyderabad can miss this iconic structure.  That said, the monument may not have a repeat value. The place is very crowded and unkept. Reaching the place is a herculean task with all that traffic, and parking is a big headache.However once in, the charm of the minar works well.  The structure is an architectural marvel. There are plenty of things to do inside that will make your day. "

Amit Khare,Feb-21,Charminar,2,Family,It was too overcrowded even to have a look properly. We went in the evening time and there was not even space to stand. There was a problem of parking near the monument hence better to go by cab. The market is also too crowded to even take a look at goods properly.
Elizabeth L,Jan-21,Charminar,5,,"We had a BLAST! This was my last day in India and I was flying out of Hyderabad, so we came to Charminar the night before. For Americans, bargaining is not a thing - how fun it was and amazing deals we received on lots of jewelry items for me to take home to my friends and family. The actual Charminar architecture is breathtaking and is a must-see for anyone in the area."
Kasi,Jan-21,Charminar,5,Couples,"Hyderabad in one of the most beautiful place charminar,  here I like bangles and falls, daily here visiting more people's, when I visited charminar ,that guy told charminar history (superb) "
Lalz,Jan-20,Charminar,1,,"The structure is iconic and is pretty much the face of Hyderabad but, is maintained horribly. I would strongly advise people not to go to the top. The staircase is extremely suffocating and cramped. No railing and once you go in, it's impossible to get out because there're people behind you. You have to get to the top, take a breather, and go down through a similar staircase. We went there and my mom almost fainted. If you're claustrophobic, DO NOT take a chance here. The marketplace isn't that well maintained either. I was born and brought up in this city and was really excited to visit the monument. Ruined everything for me."
Barbara A,Nov-20,Charminar,4,,This is in the middle of the old town with vendors all around. The charminar is impressive to look out and worth a walk to see it.

Naresh_byra,Oct-20,Charminar,5,Friends,"Majestic and it feels like first time, whenever I visit Charminar. Visited after lockdown and the charm of Charminar is alive but it is not as much crowd as it used to be.The place is getting restoration and it feel good to see our heritage is protected. Must visit place if you are into culture tours."

PurnimaJaay,Feb-20,Charminar,2,Family,"The mosque is very beautiful. If you get to go in, then please do. Out of it will be local selling cheap stuffs. Don't get fooled by their pricing. Be alert and bargain well. Stay alert all time. Don't bring kids. Get ur stuff and walk away. Only buy if you want. If not just walk. It's risky but if possible go with any local. "
Kaushik G,Jun-19,Charminar,4,Family,Charminar is one of the most popular tourist attractions in Hyderabad and we had visited the same during our sightseeing in Hyderabad. The place is very crowded with small vendors occupying the entire road outside the beautiful heritage structure. We enjoyed biscuits and tea at the nearby Nimrah Cafe and enjoyed the beauty of the Charminar right in front of us. One can go inside the Charminar up to a certain height and we saw many locals standing inside the Charminar.
Sunil,Jun-19,Charminar,4,Friends,The Charminar is very old and ancient.it looks gorgeous and lovely.But the palce located is highly denced population and its too crowded and the place is not maintained well.
Greg48,Feb-20,Charminar,4,,I first heard of the Charminar years ago by way of a cigarette brand which featured the structure on its packages.The iconic symbol of Hyderabad dates back to the 1500's and is an interesting structure with 4 Minarets and 4 arches. The area surrounding it is a busy street and jewelry market. You can find inexpensive bangles (bracelets) as well as very low priced 'pearls' which would make a cute item for young girls. There are also a number of Pearl Shops supposedly selling the gem that the city is famed for. Not being knowledgeable about jewelry I stayed with the costume jewelry and found the market to be enjoyable.
Mutukuloju Pranay,Aug-19,Charminar,5,,"Charminar is a beautiful place. visit once.it is quite good and being reconstructed again i.e repairs are being doing right now. besides, there is bangles Bazar where lot of variety bangles are there"
SrijitNewYork,Jan-20,Charminar,4,Solo,"Went to the Charminar in the early hours of the day (around 7:30am). It was perfect timing. No traffic, no crowds, no bustle in the adjoining markets... Basically, it was easy to get in and out. I've been here three times before and as always, the Charminar was under repairs, this time around too. There was a scaffold around three sides of the monument. So a good selfie wasn't possible. However, it felt good to walk around it and have an Irani tea and a wedge of Dilkhush (bread stuffed with dried fruits) as an early breakfast from one of the many tea shops in the area. I hung around for less than an hour before heading over to my next destination. "
Aratrika Basu,Jun-19,Charminar,4,,"Chaminar is a lovely place. I really like to go here quite often, but I suggest one to visit it during the month of  Ramzan. The place comes alive and is open all night. If you go there during that time, you can't leave without having the famous Hyderabadi Haleem. Nevertheless, Charaminar is awesome and one must go there when they come to Hyderabad."
Jay-Raghu-2016,Mar-20,Charminar,5,,"This was my 3rd visit to CharMinar. The only difference was it was a evening and on a Sunday.Absolutely packed by shoppers, vendors and traffic. Managed to park about 400 meters away. Great photo opportunities. Charminar was well lit and glowing. Recommend a day and evening visit after sunset."
PsychoEdinburgh,Jan-20,Charminar,4,Couples,"This is  very busy monument but worth queuing up to see. Once you've climbed the narrow stone staircase you are rewarded by lovely views of the city, fine stone carvings and multiple arches. Well worth the visit and it probably take about an hour all told"
Talent P,Feb-20,Charminar,4,,structure is an example for Indo-Islamic architecture combined with few Persian elements. The monument is located in the heart of old city and it is believed that Hyderabad was measured in four directions from Charminar for administrative purposes. 
Vinki K,Dec-19,Charminar,5,Family,Not wrong if I say that Charminaar and the area nearby is Hyderabad Ki shaan. Great view of old city from top. Awesome markets in premises. Great food and tea nearby. 
Aparajita_03,Mar-20,Charminar,3,Business,"Charminar is an icon of Hyderabad. It is possible to alight up the steep stairs to get a birds eye view of the city. However, the stairs are steep and made in a circular fashion, so aged people or anyone with even slight discomfort in walking should not explore this. The view from top is amazing.

Saurabh M,Dec-22,Golconda Fort,4,Friends,"Exploring Telangana........Hyderabad..... At the famous Golkonda fort......How to reach can take a auto or ola directly there....... Golconda Fort Hyderabad is an outstanding example of brilliant engineering and magical architecture. Located at a distance of 11km from the city, it is the most famous of all Hyderabad tourist places. The name of the fort has been derived from the Telugu words ""Golla"" and ""Konda"" which together means 'Shepherd's Hill'.An impressive structure, which once, would have bewitched every onlooker, stands majestically even today. Golconda Fort is sure to impress you with not only with that highly advanced techniques were used back then and sturdy structure, but also with an outstanding view of the surrounding city.Founded in the approximately 12th Century by the Kakatiya Kings, this massive Golconda Fort with eight gates and 87 bastions was later built by Qutub Shahi Kings.The name Golconda Fort has a legend behind it. As per the story, a shepherd boy was once walking on this hill when he had come across a God idol. The news about the shepherd boy and his findings reached the then ruler of Kakatiya Dynasty. The King then decided to built a fort on the hill, which then came to be known as Golconda (Shepherd‚Äôs Hill) Fort.However, almost 200 years later, the fort came under Bahamani rulers. Later Qutub Shahi Kings took the fort under their control and extended it further. The fort was fortified and expanded during the reign of Bahamani rulers and Qutub Shahi Dynasty. Later in 1687, this fort came under the rule of Mughal emperor Aurangzeb. It was then the fort was left unattended.At present, the Golconda Fort constitutes a complex layout of palaces, temple mosques and pavilion, all of which unfortunately are in ruins now.Architecture of Golconda FortWith perimeters of around 11 kilometers, the fort has 15 to 18 foot high walls. It has huge gates that have pointed iron spikes on them. This protected the fort from Elephants damaging the fort as well as enemy attacks. Golconda fort presents a mesmerizing architecture which will astonish you at each and every step. This fort has been built on a granite rock with a height of 12 meters. Huge rampart around the golconda fort was built, a glimpse of which can still be seen.The system of acoustics in the Fort is something which attracts each and every visitor. The sound of clapping at the entrance can be heard at the ‚ÄòBala Hissar' which is the highest point and almost a kilometre away. This system was apparently used for communication purposes, especially to alert royal in case of any attack.Other attractive features of the Fort include water supply system which does leave many marvelling at the advancement of the technical and scientific knowledge while constructing this fort. Another popular aspect is the 'Rahban' cannon.Ramdas‚Äô prison is one of the popular spots inside the fort. According to legend, Ramdas who was a revenue collector in Abdul Hasan Shah's court was imprisoned. During his imprisonment, he carved Hindu deities on the wall of his cell. One can see many carvings of Hindu Lord Hanuman on the wall, which are now smeared with holy vermillion. A holy lamp or two (diyas) is also kept lit in front of the carvings."
Nazura Javed,Dec-22,Golconda Fort,3,,"The place is in ruins , needs better maintenance  and amenities like toilets. The approach road is through crowded narrow roads. Reaching the top of the fort requires a bit of stamina for one has to climb up steps and it can be a little hard for those not used to it. Also the day we went the place was pretty crowded.The good thing is that one does get a feel of history (especially if one is somewhat aware of Deccan India history) and also a great view of the city once you reach the top of the fort."
Ruzan Desai,Dec-22,Golconda Fort,5,,The Golconda fort is a great place for spending half a day. It is recommended to take the government approved guides( INR 750) to understand the true essence of the place. The guides are helpful with showing the stellar architectural nuances of whispering walls and echo points. It is worth climbing to the top of the fort. It is about 400 steps each way. The city view is excellent from there- panoramic in every sense of the word. There is a stall on the top with basic water and chocolates which provides adequate replenishments.
jojo,Dec-22,Golconda Fort,4,,We visited the fort in the noon time. Ticket was Rs 25 per adult. It was almost crowded. But it was properly maintained. The fort was very beautiful and has historical importance. Having a majestic look spread over with memories of the past. Excited crowds being busy with photographs and the excellent scenic background.Guides were available.
Andrew D,Dec-22,Golconda Fort,4,Solo,"Compared with other forts in India, Golconda is not particularly different but it does have a good view of the surrounding areas from the top. That being said, I would still recommend a visit to the Golconda Fort for a taste of how lives must have been during the nizam's times."
vasant agshikar,Dec-22,Golconda Fort,5,Couples,I visited the fort and took a guide who provided me good enough about the fort. It is advisable you negotiate with the guide .the fort is well maintained and one can enjoy the view from various levels of the fort. The view from the top most point of the is awesome. The 700 step well is an uphill tasks if your having health issues like heart BP etc kindly avoid taking the stairs. The architectural is amazing and the science behind construction is also an interesting subject to study to know how advance we were then. It would take you 2 hrs to cover the entire area with enough rest and photography.

Raman G,Nov-22,Golconda Fort,4,Couples,"We visited the fort as part of our holiday to Hyderabad.  It is part of your sightseeing itinerary.  Managed by Archaeology Survey of India. We did not take a guide. ( as compared, for Agra fort you surely need a guide). It is mainly a walk in the grounds and a abt 300 step walk to the highest point in the fort open for tourists.

OctOriental,Nov-22,Golconda Fort,4,,"Straightaway you get a feel of history of an old fort. It looks good as well, spanning a great distance from left to right.

Well...The fort has toilets. Climbing a few steps does afford good views. But you could go all the way up. Guides are there everywhere and could try to inveigle you by authoritatively directing you away from your chosen path as if it's not the way to go. It's easy to shake them off. Just ignore. But if you have a lot of time to spend there and are interested in history, apocryphal or not, maybe a guide could be helpful. But at the entrance there's a stone with brief history inscribed on it. Do read it to get some first hand history."

For example there is a spot where if you clap you can hear an echo but walk two steps away from that spot and there is no echo. The age of the Fort is comparable to the early Norman kings of England - I had no idea that buildings like this existed in India that far back.There is a lot to see, and a lot to climb - depending on how adventurous you are you could climb to the top mosque.Alas there is a entry fee for Indians and a much higher fee for foreigners......"

But do beware, there are several spots where the guards warn you not to venture into as some stone structures have loosened up and could collapse. Some people disregard the warnings. Well...The fort has toilets. Climbing a few steps does afford good views. But you could go all the way up. Guides are there everywhere and could try to inveigle you by authoritatively directing you away from your chosen path as if it's not the way to go. It's easy to shake them off. Just ignore. But if you have a lot of time to spend there and are interested in history, apocryphal or not, maybe a guide could be helpful. But at the entrance there's a stone with brief history inscribed on it. Do read it to get some first hand history."
madhavi2022,Nov-22,Golconda Fort,5,,read up before you go - guides are scalpers. Reach early to dodge the heat and crowds! Mask up as poor social distancing
Chandra J,Oct-22,Golconda Fort,5,Friends,Easy trek up hillside unless you have problems navigating stairs.  Great views of the city and of the whole area.  Helpful with a guide so you know what you're looking at
casandeep,Oct-22,Golconda Fort,5,,If you are visiting Hyderabad this place you must visit. Though you will have to walk a lot but its worth to do so.  Taking a guide along is must if you really want to understand the rich history and the beautiful architecture. How things were visualized 500 years back is simply unbelievable.
skychaserCalgary,Oct-22,Golconda Fort,5,,"Very historical place, walked up to the top and back down again‚Ä¶.superb views of the city from on the top"
Michael M,Sep-22,Golconda Fort,5,,"We were in Hyderabad for work but I was taken with colleagues to the Fort so I could see some of Hyderabad not just do work.The old (800+ years old) decorative carving showing the connection to what is now called Iran was incredible.There are several locations that have perfect acoustics - experiencing them is the only way to give it justice as words fail. For example there is a spot where if you clap you can hear an echo but walk two steps away from that spot and there is no echo. The age of the Fort is comparable to the early Norman kings of England - I had no idea that buildings like this existed in India that far back.There is a lot to see, and a lot to climb - depending on how adventurous you are you could climb to the top mosque.Alas there is a entry fee for Indians and a much higher fee for foreigners......"
ullacarinquiterio,Oct-22,Golconda Fort,3,,The fort was a nice experience but the biggest disappointment was that there is no  sound and light show as it is under repairs and no-one can tell when it will start again. 
sramanujamk,Oct-22,Golconda Fort,5,,A must place to visit with children. Take a guide and learn both history and acoustic engineering mastered by our ancestors before the invention of electrical sound systems and communications! The whispering wall and alert arena are must-watch.

Alok Kumar,Mar-20,Golconda Fort,5,Solo,Golconda Fort is in the outskirts of city... the tourist guide are must who explains the stories of glory .. they will take yiy back hundreds of years back.. in history... Good for visiting in a cloudy day.. as it's hot in summer.. Specially if sun is scrotchy .. govwirh goggles and umbrella
The Route Edit,Jan-20,Golconda Fort,4,Solo,"This was my second visit to the fort. Last time we visited we didn't have time for the light and sound show so this time I made it a point to stay back for it. The fort itself is very beautiful provided you like historical places or else it would seem brick and mortar debri. Take a registered guide and remember to bargain for the rate coz without a guide it might seem boring. The view from the top is worth the climb and do check the amazing architectural acoustics of the fort. Coming to the light and sound show, I would suggest you give it a miss. They give you a complimentary odomos tube with the tickets so you can imagine the amount of mosquitoes you are about to face during the show. You will be so busy battling mosquitoes that the real battle stories wouldn't seem that interesting. I sat there and dozed off for a major part of the show. I like history and have watched lots of light and sound shows but I guess this experience wasn't that great for me. "
Nipunika J,Apr-19,Golconda Fort,3,Couples,"Visited it in late afternoon in December hence was pretty hot. It was pretty crowded, the fort is interesting place. Worth a visit when in Hyderabad. The roads around are narrow, hence plan your visit likewise if driving there. "

EASWAR52,Jun-23,Golconda Fort,3,Family,"Golconda fort is one of the very old structures in Hyderabad. This is spread over a huge area. Here we can enjoy the beauty of olden constructions, their architectural richness and their technological knowledge. The complex is provided with a compound wall of olden times all-round which gives a clear picture of the past life.It contains past structures which includes gate ways, bastions, royal palace, durbar hall etc which takes us to the past era. The water supply system present here and defensive mechanisms provided are really wonderful.Here one can experience the perfect acoustics provided in the structures. The fort displays past history. Last but not the least is the fact that one must be ready to walk for long distances to cover the vast area of the fort.Overall, it is worth spending time in the fort to understand the past and to gauge the technological richness of India in the olden days.Great experience."
Mr. Himanshu Sinha,Jan-23,Golconda Fort,5,Solo,"Golkunda Fort is Hugeee, it's like a day activity, if you want to explore each and every corner of it, I went to the peak of it and came down in around 2 hours, the fort is still in good shape. whenever you visit here you will find the fort is always filled with people, I didn't saw much police or staff to take care. People throw garbage here and there, making reels, dancing and all. everyone is living and loving these place only for the Views."

The strategic layout of the fort showcases intelligent planning, with various levels, intricate water supply systems, and defensive mechanisms that were ahead of their time."
fudxplorer,Dec-22,Golconda Fort,5,Friends,A must visit fort if you are in hyderabad. A vast structure and lot of climbing to do. A lot of places to take pics. Evenings are crowded
W S,Feb-23,Golconda Fort,4,Friends,"This fort is vast.  It has so much history.  I visited without the tour guide and felt like I did not miss out.  However, whilst walking around, I met a group of people from the USA (although their manager came from the UK but lives in the States now), and they said the tour guide was excellent.  So I cannot really comment on what experience they provide.  They sell books on the history.  Be prepared to walk and have comfortable shoes.   The climb to the top is worth it though as you see for miles.  It is an amazing structure. "

Sudipta Shaheen,Jan-23,Ramoji Film City,4,Family,"Its a very good place to njoy with your family and kids. Very well organised and well maintained place. Take the basic plan. Do not waste your money in AC  package. Do try to visit in winter months only. In hot seqson, it wont be possible to roam around. It willbe extremely hot.They do not allow food inside. You will get ample options for food and beverages."

Dr.Saravanan Chandran,Feb-23,Ramoji Film City,5,,"One of the must see at Hyderabad, you need a day to see most of the places, reach at 9am stay up to 7pm, maintained up to the international standard. "
Amit Bansal,Jan-23,Ramoji Film City,3,,"A good experience going around the film city.I booked a package from Ramoji website. The first half was checking around sets via an A/C bus with guide followed by a lunch.The lunch at Superstar hotel was really not as per Ramoji's standard. Poor state of veg food, pathetically slow roti service. Not worth the price. Taste was just OK. If the restaurant can not handle volume, then they should not even entertain that much of volume.The stalls outside offered much better food.The shows were great as well, the package that I opted was too lengthy for my enthusiasm, at around 5 PM, I wish there were no more shows. I wanted a good tea with some snacks, that experience was not that great as well. Food & restaurants surely needs to improve for the prices that are offered for.There was a winter fest that made the place even beautiful with lights, perhaps, I had left with no energy & zeal to enjoy that.It was a good experience, wish I had got some good food."
Kapil R,Jan-23,Ramoji Film City,1,Couples,"Very unprofessional peoples, i have booked transport for pickup from santosh dhaba, begum bazar nd pickup time was 7:15. But no one reached there nd when talk to customer care even they also don‚Äôt know about the pickup. After that they ( mohammed Yasir) are asking us to come to another point nd giving  excuses that by mistake santosh dhaba was printed on ticket.I don‚Äôt understand that how there could be misprinting.My parents are senior citizens those who are facing this problem."
Rajesh Ramamurthy,Dec-22,Ramoji Film City,5,,"The sheer enormity of this place means travelers are bound to be left wondering about the logistics of moving around. Believe me, as a family of four including two children, we found the logistics was handled seamlessly. The guides were well informed and the trip moved in a sequential manner. Facilities such as rest rooms, restaurants etc. were also positioned to the advantage of all guests. Highly recommended"
Mel12939,Feb-22,Ramoji Film City,5,,"Massive, huge, mesmerizing, literally takes you one complete day to wander around each and every beautiful aspect of making a film, hospitable people, neatly maintained, good souvenirs, overall would definitely recommend.  "
Avijit,Dec-22,Ramoji Film City,2,Family,"Sheer waste of time and money as I said in title. If managementbthoughtbthat they can mix fast food and  heavy lunch together, then this can happen. One can neither see the things they mightbfeel interesting although there is nothing much to see, except some old film sets, nor one can get time to enjoy the rides available for kids. The other entertainments are what ones get to see in circus , like action stunts, dance show, etc. In the digital era, these does not entice people. They should make it clear whether they want to promote it as game and rides park or mere tour of some so called fancy sets"
SREENIVASAREDDY M,Dec-22,Ramoji Film City,5,Family,"Situated in the middle of green hills, away from city buzzing, with good stay & food arrangements, originally meant for fil. shootings of various locations like  various township locations, gardens, fountains, forts, tempkes, rly Station, bus station, busy areas, parks, zoo, birdirium and incl.of recent blockbuster like BAHUBALI sets also can seen alive.Two days tour actually required to enjoy the serene of this spot. There are various tariff hotels to stay, all sorts if food out let's, any point to any point free bus service etc privileges of this property."
Raman G,Nov-22,Ramoji Film City,4,Couples,"It is a full day tour. About 40 km from Hyderabad.  The largest film city complex in the world. The owners of film city also organize tours for guests for the huge complex. Tours from around 9 am to 530 pm. We took a Star experience tour. Booked online in advance from their website. ( they have a toll free number as well for any enquiries) . It is a guided tour of the grounds, sets and the special shows. The advantage is that this tour   is communicating in a AC bus. Which was definitely a comfort for us. It includes a buffet  lunch- which was ok. If you need, the organizers also arrange a bus pick up and drop from various  points in Hyderabad. But depending on your pick up location. It can be a 2 hour ride in the bus to the film city. We hired a taxi for full day. ( abt Rs 3000 for the day). We reached a bit before 10 am. It is recommended to reach by 9 am as they ask to, as the tour definitely ends at 530pm. We did notice that for return to Hyderabad in the evening  there are stalls at film city for return transport , but do not know the charge? ( in case you only take a drop to film city by own transport). You can visit the film city without booking any of the tour package as well. It will be a walk in for the tickets. We noticed that these are quite crowded as a group. If you have visited any such film city  tours abroad, say in Singapore or San Francisco, these are very much of a very high standard and quality in thrills and excitement and experience as compared to Ramoji.But in India, it is surely one a kind. Tour includes, rides, walk through bird parks, gardens, visit film sets,  walk through film sets and shows. The latter include a dance and song show as well.Our tour was very well set up and organised."
Praveen Anand,Nov-22,Ramoji Film City,5,,"Learn about the film making and visit many locations, which were part of many great films. Very well  clean and maintained place. You need full day to visit"

It's a must stay place for all travelers. The ambience, the location, the spread and specially Bahubali Area makes you feel speechless.Loved our stay and will cherish for a long time."
Raj,Oct-22,Ramoji Film City,1,Friends,"Waste of time.Not organised at all.Simply waste of time is queue.They asked all people to go to movie magic first and then  Doll store.. And so on. But instead they could have split the teams so we can avoid  waiting time.And also iits not worth waiting in queue and watching some dances. They are olden days strategy.

Ashish G,Sep-22,Ramoji Film City,4,,"Ramoji Film City is a wonderful experience and a must visit. I'll list down some delighters and things that can be improved based on my experience.  Pros first1. Lots of things to do and experiences to have. 2. The shows are very impressive. Spirit of Ramoji, Wild West were in particular very nice. 3. There were a good amount of rides for children and adults to enjoy. 4. The eco park was very good, especially the bonsai collection was amazing to see. 5. Haunted house was a good experience for kids. Things that can be improved1. The brochure was very confusing. There is no way you can cover all the things in Ramoji in a day, so the brochure should give more detailed information which helps the people to choose based on their interest. 2. We took the star experience package which was the more expensive one. However they kept passing us from one person to other person without anyone explaining what is the plan for the day. Even on asking they were not interested to answer and just kept pointing to someone else. It felt we missed out on lots of things simply because no-body told us. Also the bus was so overcrowded that everyone did not even got a seat and lots of time was wasted in sorting that out. The star experience didn't feel worth the money and I felt I would have been better off with a regular ticket and planning the day myself, rather than leaving it to the star experience providers. 3.  Don't think this falls under the jurisdiction of Ramoji, but the travel to and from Ramoji was a big headache. We booked a ticket via BestBus which seemed to show on their site that they are the official partners with Ramoji. However it was a bad experience, as they kept asking us to change pickup point without realizing how difficult it would be for someone to reach different pickup point at short notice. Even while drooping off they didn't drop us at our designated dropping point. I would strongly suggest giving BESTBUS a skip and find another option to reach there."
Shafeeq T,Aug-22,Ramoji Film City,4,Friends,"Ramoji Film City is the thematic holiday destination and The World‚Äôs Largest Film Studio Complex. A 1, 600-acre land gifts the spectacular experience of exploring the wonderful attractions of the world at one destination. It is an awesome place to visit with family & friends."
reshma r,May-22,Ramoji Film City,5,,"I went there in May 2022 (during the carnival season) with my husband and nephews. Everybody loved that place. The place has so much to offer, including - learning about movie making process, adventure sports, food, music, DJ, dance performances, martial art performances, gifts for participants, beautiful movie sets, green gardens, butterfly garden, and so on. We spent over 12 hours and it was worth it. The ticket cost was approx. 1200 per person, but it's worth every penny. There is bus service inside, you can go from one point to another by bus (no additional cost). Bring your own water bottle as there is a drinking water tap at every point where you can refill your water bottle for free. I am planning to go there again with my parents in November.Only advice - go there when the weather is nice and keep in mind that you will spend at least 6-8 hours outdoors."
TamilAmerican,Sep-22,Ramoji Film City,3,,"This family friendly huge entertainment zone was unique. Right from the entry, where we were given chocolates and sets to take interesting themed photos, the trip was amazing. A van took us to different points like Alauddin ride, shows about making the movie, sets where each entrance was a different building etc. The guide was charming and explained the significance of different spots along with the famous movies directed there. The gardens were spacious and well maintained. The best part of the trip was the Bahubali set. We loved the magnificent ensemble."
Vaishnavi_g,Sep-22,Ramoji Film City,5,,"Dont ask a local hyderabi about visiting this place. They say, what is there in it !!! But believe me it is really wonderful for an outsider. You will be taken through a guided tour, and you will get to see cine-settings, best of it is, Bahubali setting, Mahabharata, Ramyana... Then you will have a 4D show... Eco park where for the first time I saw the birds , geese etc left to freely fly around although inside a fenced area. You can just walk through them...Got to hold a maccaw in hand.... And adventure rides.... Worth giving an entire day for it.     Dont bother if a local says, dont waste your one day on it. Just go for it. It is worth going atleast once here. "
Biswajit M,Dec-21,Ramoji Film City,2,,"Its not worth visit as its very mundane and old school , its actually a studio being open for tourists who have nothing else to do and only have time to waste and spend money"
Konganapally Laasya,Jun-22,Ramoji Film City,4,,Since I am an Indian Hindu my family has some traditions And since I am 10 years old i have to start wearing half sarees For that we need to throw a party as my first day wearing half sareeWe threw that party in Ramoji Film City hawa mahal and everything was great the food the atmosphere and everything we book hotel rooms in Tara hotel and we stayed for a night the next morning we did a photo shoot in Ramoji Film City The reason I gave four stars is because it was really expensive it nearly cost 3 lakhs and the next morning my rooms shower broke and the hair dryer was not working But still you should visit Ramoji Film City cause it‚Äôs the greatest experience I‚Äôve ever had 
Dattatray Bhat,Jul-22,Ramoji Film City,5,Couples,"I had visited ramoji, couple of years earlier. But now they have done some additions such as bahubali set, space yatra etc and also butterfly gardens, sahas adventure park, you will atlest 2 days to see the whole place and enjoy."
Elias M,Jul-22,Ramoji Film City,5,,"Large, Beautiful, Fun place to visit with family. One of the best places to visit stepping away from the hustle and bustle of the city and fast life in Hyderabad. Enjoy the cool, calm and beautiful time place with family."
Suresh K,Sep-21,Ramoji Film City,4,,Very much enjoyed with Family. Very large place to cover. Inside commuting is very good. You can spend the whole day is not enough to cover everything. Very much interesting to watch how they filming. 
Mayank G,Nov-21,Ramoji Film City,5,,"This overall Ramoji Rao Film City tour experience like watching huge budget film on big screen . This tour is full of action, emotion, drama, music and dance . Just Amazing and unique place. But in my opinion this tour must be two days because only one whole day you can not cover this huge area . Nevertheless one day trip is also enjoyable. This is one trip where you can understand the process of film making . Lovely! Total Blockbuster Place."
lkoraj,Jun-22,Ramoji Film City,4,Family,"A very good place, very much decorated shooting points and beautiful gardens, good for children entertainment, nice shows like adventure, dance, film making process, space yatra, filmi duniya, action etc, big film sets are a very good attraction of this place, overall a good place to see."
Tubby,Jun-22,Ramoji Film City,1,Solo,"Caves, wild west, birds show, and space yatra good showsBut Buses force you to go from one spot to anther and there is no option to go directly to the starting point I would specifically call out Sangam restaurant that forces one to pay rs350/head for unlimited food!! They need to learn from Chowki Dhani, Jaipur how unlimited food is served!! They go around the tables to serve people and people eating dont have to go again n again to get smthing! Worst is on reaching the buffet spot, you may not even find the dish you came for ü´§. Plus, Ramuji and family, when you source out to these caterers do you even chk what they are serving and how? Do you eat rasam in a thali at your home? My suggestion.. ramuji and family, plz come to this place as a tourist and then share your review as well!!!"
Jalpesh Rojasara,May-22,Ramoji Film City,5,Family,"Must visit once in life time. Take standard tickets. No need to take star experience tickets. Well organized visit by film city staff, just follow their instructions u will not miss single  Location or live shows. Plenty of free drinking water stands with chilled and hygiene water. Plenty of food options with price on higher side. They provide guided tour in their vintage style red bus in film city. More than 2000 movie shooting done here. Bahubali set is ok. 3 hotels name tara, sitara and shantiniketan are within film city. Reach at 9 am so u can watch opening ceremony. 2 lines for tickets, 1 for direct ticket from ticket counter and onther who have online tickets. Evening parade is good. In evening whole film city is decorated by lights so u feel u are in another world. Must experience this. Most of rides are complementary free. At sahas adventure location u will enjoy adventure rides free of cost. One full day required for visit. Kids zone is also good and photogenic. Star experience tickets has ac bus, food coupon, welcome chocolate box not worth for its price. Local taxi from hyderabad city available at 1000 to 2000 fair rate. Plenty of free parking lots available at ticket counter. If u have hotel booking u can take u r private car upto hotel. So enjoy ur visit u will definitely remember it. "
Amol S,May-22,Ramoji Film City,1,Family,"We visited this place with lot of expectations but were left very disappointed with overall experience!Total ticket cost for family of 2 adults and 2 kids was 5400 for absolutely nothing worth mentioning to see Horror starts right from beginning when u are asked to park car 5 kms away from main premise. From there all tourists are put in outdated buses like prisoners and taken to main film city area .So once you are in you just can not leave place without going through entire torture. Guided tour lasts only about 30 mins and after that you are left there from point to point to explore nothing. Adventure sports area sports like paintball , archery are all useless. For paintball just one person standing there asking u to shoot 3 shots on target . Archery session arch set looks like it is third class china toy bought at 100 from local market. That also only one ser is there. In short what is included in ticket is all useless stuff but advertised by Mr Ramoji as if its out of the world Sahaj adventure sports .For kids only space yatra which lasted for 5 mins and bird park was only area worth mentioning.In addition like prisoners you are not allowed to carry any food inside . Firstly with exorbitant ticket cost now they like are further allowed to take more money from your pocket.Restaurant called Jimmy is total useless with third grade food at five star prices .Worst is you cant leave place as you are stuck there !!Pls avoid avoid and donate money to some needy !!!"
dr MADHUSUDAN SR,May-22,Ramoji Film City,5,Family,Ramoji film City was a pleasant experience... We had a day full of activities and exciting events organised by the staff.. they were V good and guided us nicely thru the different spots...  Food was good... Quite costly..üôÇ Rooms were small although neat... 
queenspr,Apr-22,Ramoji Film City,3,,"Was told we will be watching a live shoot, didn't happenThe Film city is huge but the tour is nothing but a gigantic park with various attractions "
Sourabh Singh,Apr-22,Ramoji Film City,1,Family,If u want to exit early in case of emergency u can't...never visit with children below age of 5 years there will be risk in case of any emergency..event which happens in Eureka is fake..they randomly select person as a winner and force them to stay there till events completed...if u have your own vehicle visit then only because taxi and auto charge unnecessarily very huge amount
AjithBhaskaran,Mar-22,Ramoji Film City,4,,"Worth a visit if you are on a trip to Hyderabad - it is around 1 1/2 hours drive from City Centre. Gives an idea as to how films are made and sets are constructed. Need to either reach by around 9 am or better still stay there in one of the hotels inside RFC the previous evening as you need a full day to see everything. Even a full day is a bit rushed. Best to pick up tickets ('Studio Tour' is good enough) online, go to the centre point (Eureka), attend the opening ceremony at 9.45 am, proceed to Studio Tour/Eco Tour (must do), have lunch, then go for the shows. Don't miss the Wild West Stunt Show! Lights, Camera, Action is interesting too. Rest of the shows are average, especially for someone who has been to other studios/sets elsewhere. Pick up a brochure and plan your day ahead. Food within RFC is average or even below average."
Ipshita M,Apr-22,Ramoji Film City,5,Family,"Great place.FILM CITY: To call it expansive might be an insult since it's the world's largest, however it truly was ginormous. We loved the spots we saw and the carefully curated sets. The Japanese Gardens were a delight in particular and we loved the Bird Park. Had no idea they had such an amazing collection and the birds looked like they were vey well taken care of. The Moviemaking Part was amazing and the 'Director' was very funny.OUR GUIDE: Loved our guide Datta Ji. He was very patient and very courteous. He let us choose which spots we wished to disembark for and offered to take our pictures everywhere we went. He was very funny, jovial and amiable person.FOOD: The buffet at Sitara was sufficient so was the taste.OVERALL, it's truly a must visit spot if you come to Hyderabad"

Chitranjan G,Oct-21,Ramoji Film City,5,,"The Theme Suite, the location, the cleanliness, car parking, courteous staff etc were to my satisfaction. I have always enjoyed my stay at Sitara. I enjoy nature walk and it offers plenty to bask in the sun or just get ""Me Time"" in the nature."
Tushar D,Oct-21,Ramoji Film City,4,Family,My 5 year old son enjoyed. But same time he tired also. I think it‚Äôs ok trip for adult. If someone has interest in movie then that person will enjoy the trip. Area is huge. Food is somewhat costly. Try to visit on weekdays.
Dragon,Oct-21,Ramoji Film City,5,Family,"I have bought Star Experience package and our guide was Sudhakar and i give full 10/10 rating for the whole experience (Oct 31, 2021)"
Abhishek Sharma,Apr-21,Ramoji Film City,5,,one of the best palces to visit during you stay in hyderabad.Dont visit on weekends as it will be overcroweded.
Raviraj Rodrigues,Aug-21,Ramoji Film City,5,,"The property is built on the lines of Disneyworld, but at a much lower scale and finish quality. However for the entry price, I would say its worth a one time visit. We got to see many sets. both live and ready for shooting. Some of them are permanent like Mughal gardens, Rajput Palaces, Wild West, Indian Village scenes etc. Some others were created for one movie and left for tourists to enjoy like the sets of Bahubali. They have some lovely gardens, bird park and butterfly park too. However, one can truly enjoy the place only by staying inside the filmcity in one of their hotels for atleast 2 nights. There is too much to see and do and the guided tour of 2.5 hours will not do justice to the place. We could spend early mornings and late evening on the sets and gardens as we stayed in the resort and were permitted to move around. "
Neha Banerjee,Aug-21,Ramoji Film City,5,,We visited recently in Covid times. 1 excellent thing is it's closed for outside but open for people who are staying. So the crowd was minimal.We stayed in the Sitara hotel.We enjoyed hassle-free check-in. Then Ramoji tour and Bahubali tour. Hardly 10-15 ppl which was excellent as per the pandemic situation. Few parks were open and in lush greenery so it was just a close-to-nature trip.My toddler could run around freely and enjoyed it a lot.I will surely visit again.
Appu M,Aug-20,Ramoji Film City,3,Family,It was actually great experience but tiresome ... Once u have entered its Mandatory to complete whole tour ... Food inside is very costly .. and they don't let you take your own food
Lalatendu S,Jul-20,Ramoji Film City,4,,Good experience in Ramoji Film City. Remembered all the movies shoot here. Food is not good inside and no other facilities to chill out.
valivali,Apr-21,Ramoji Film City,5,,"I visited film city on 01-04-2021. It was excellent. Best Place to visit in Hyderabad. Best for Families, Friends, Couples, Children's and for every one. Best in hospitality. Best Cooperative Employees. Best Guides. Comfortable, Clean & Neat every place including washrooms. Foot-by-Foot water facilities with cool and disposable glass also. Infact one day was not enough to enjoy the entire film city, minimum 02 days. Guidance and Hospitality towards us was very much appreciable. We ate Veg-Food and it was good, but price was Rs.300/- comparing to outside of film city it cost just or below 100/-. So Price was pretty much higher. Except food all are reasonable rates. Unfortunately i forgot my bag at clock room and left HYD and reached my home town. After contacted them they were very helpful and responded in a cooperative nature. After some phone calls and messages, i got my bag via courier and all things were as same as left bag(No things were missed nor disturbed yet).Finally i give 05 stars for film city and 1 star for Food Rate."
muralidhar r,Mar-21,Ramoji Film City,5,Family,Family its come to plan emoji film city it's good plase and good food also new gardens and new children park and goodentertene ment iam very happy the company  provide the ramoji film city enjoy the trip.
simran,Mar-21,Ramoji Film City,5,Friends,Your hyderabad trip is not complete if you don't make a visit to this place. As i am from hyderabad and all those who visit us for a holiday we make sure to take them to this place. This time it was my 8th visit to RFC. Wonderful experience as always. As this place is huge it take the entire day. Make sure to take rest the next day of the visit as it drains you. 
Bhavesh Bariya,Mar-21,Ramoji Film City,1,Family,Terrible experience...Started the journey early morning...7.30..very far isolated from main city. They don't allow any kind of food item... selling their food items in their stalls at very high rates....20 rupees item available at the rate of 80 rupees. Also all the items are fast food...so small children and elderly may suffer from hypoglycemia...no healthy choices available...It's only money making business... ticket rates are already very high...the difference between adult and children rate only 200rupees...not in capacity to visit the tour by middle class...who have earned the money by hard work...No resting place with shadow at some points...can not visit again...After visiting the place you are the most tired person...Food must be available at reasonable price or visitors should be allowed food items to carry...

Amit Khare,Feb-21,Ramoji Film City,4,Family,Do‚Äôs 1. Reach early.2. Take a bus tour at the earliest to first know the place and then prioritize the locations. 3. Prioritize as per own choice. 4. Carry water. Don‚Äôts 1. Waste time in initial photography as there are many places to click pics. 2. Don‚Äôt wait for kids rides till the end as the crowd increases towards later half.

Amit Anshu,Feb-20,Ramoji Film City,5,Family,"Great place to hangout with friends and family ,some much new things you will come across ,there is bahubali set also there is artificial foreign country, artificial village everything you will see there wht you see in movie..."
Desi Ghumakkad,Oct-20,Ramoji Film City,5,Couples,I went there with my wife & friends. It is situated nearby to Hyderabad Airport. I just loved the place. I saw so many sets of different films. It took complete one day to go through each and every part of Ramoji Film City. It's a complete one day picnic. I have enjoyed throughly. 
TravelbuggIndia,Feb-20,Ramoji Film City,5,,"Ramoji Fiml City is the largest film city in the world and it is a good place to visit with family for a day of incursion. It has fun rides, film sets and the most popular Bahubali movie set."
Pawanpreet,Nov-19,Ramoji Film City,5,Family,"ramoji is like a dream. I had not experienced anything like this before in one go. As it is spread in a huge area you need to board a bus to reach the first point from where your MAGICAL JOURNEY BEGINS. From there it is that super  sweet red bus to take you along.It is so interesting and intriguing and beautiful that you dont want it to end. Honestly you cannot see all in a day. Though I visited this place 2 years ago I m still in love with it. When this covid menace is over I would certainly go there again to regenerate myrself.  Its just lovely. I can bet that like me you too will be amazed. Go and visit if you are in hyderabad.  If you don't see ramoji you will regret it for sure. But a little piece of caution. The story goes that it is haunted, which is still a mystery for me."

SAMRAT84,Dec-19,Ramoji Film City,5,,"i visited this place three times in last 10 years because you will never feel bored with this place.really amazing place to visit with your family i am mentioning family because alone you will not enjoy the fullest.i visited the place in the month of december,i will recommend everyone to vsit in dec last week or january first week because in this time they do special events for new year celebration.the place is really very neat and clean and the events are awesome.entry time is 8am and closing time depends upon events varies between 7pm to 8pm,please reconfirm with official website about the timings.you will find everything there like fake movie shooting,fake railway plateform,airport and if you are lucky enough than u can see live shooting of a movie.in 12 hours of journey inside the ramoji premises u will not get bored for a single moment.i will not recommend this place if someone is ill or having issue with long walking as in many places you have to walk alot because during site seeing you have to walk where bus can not proceed.overall in my opinion this is the place where everyone should go at least once in his lifetime."
PurnimaJaay,Feb-20,Ramoji Film City,5,Family,"Had a great time here. Indian Universal Studio. Everything is nice here. Food, tour guide, location and activities inside. Complimentary given. Only don't go during summer. Bad choice. "
Kaushik G,Dec-19,Ramoji Film City,5,Couples,"We had visited Ramoji Film City on a day tour during our holiday in Hyderabad. We had booked tickets online through Makemytrip priced at 1150 rupees per person and collected physical tickets from the counter at Ramoji Film City. Once inside the gate, a bus took us to the actual amusement park area. There was a grand welcome show with song and dance at 9.45 am. Next we boarded their red bus for a grand tour which took us to different locations like Bahubali movie set, Japanese Gardens, London street, Butterfly park, Bird park, Kripalu caves and many more. In the 2nd half we attended different mind boggling shows out of which the best was the Spirit of Ramoji show. In between we squeezed time for burgers and fries. To sum it up, this was surely one of the great experience to cherish for a lifetime."
Sunil,Jul-19,Ramoji Film City,4,Friends,The best place to vist in hyderbad and its too huge to coverall the place since the ramoji city and they have well maintained.its worth every penny 
Greg48,Feb-20,Ramoji Film City,4,,"This was an fun way to spend a few hours. It is listed as the World's largest film studio, and indeed the tram tour dovers acres of land and a multitude of film sets. You can possible see ongoing filming and the attractions and occasional performers that you meet are entertaining.As an visiting American, I wasn't familiar with the films that had been made here, but nonetheless was impressed with the studio lots and the tram tour. Everything was professionally done and the staff was good about getting people back ontime after each stop. I note that the tour was not in English, but that didn't really affect my ability to enjoy and understand what we were seeing."
NAZEER SHAIK,Mar-20,Ramoji Film City,5,,Very popular and one of the most visiting place. So many people are coming from different places. Good
Shashi Prakash Mishra,Mar-20,Ramoji Film City,5,Family,It's tough to write a review..It's a place where you will get physically tired but mentally you will remain overcharged..
Ratan,Mar-20,Ramoji Film City,5,,Very helpful and cordial people giving service in the film city. One can come to know how actually a film is made and what is the important role of people not only onscreen or behind the screen.
Alok Kumar,Mar-20,Ramoji Film City,5,Solo,Ramoji Film City is a full day excursion .. u can be stunned if yiu see the film sets .. and will understand why all the streets and all railway platform look similar in films... They bring a clarity to your perception towards the stories of bollywood movies.. I mean u will fell amused .. the bird park is a treat to nature lovers
Jaykann,Feb-20,Ramoji Film City,5,Family,Must to do while you are in Hyderabad. Plan one full day activity as so much things to see and activities to do. This place entertainers not only kids and teenagers but to all age groups. Well organized guided tour and memorable experience from the moment you step in until you leave the place. Whole property is very well maintained. Plenty of photo options for photography lovers.While we come across each sets it reminds of some movie of any Indian language. Highlight is Bahubaali set for our group. Lot of walking involved inside but great experience.Definitely with high standards and competitive comparison with other similar concept around the world. It was not really fully crowded probably because of school examinations time and week day as well. Great memorable experience. Descent food options available inside at decent price range. Definitely 5 stars and each penny worth spending.
Rashmi_Warty,Feb-20,Ramoji Film City,5,,"Much better than what we had seen in a similar theme park in Australia. Perhaps the Indianisation helps. It seemed that the target population was (also) people who could not go outside India and the objective was to offer them a well crafted and entertaining content at a reasonable price, without burning a hole in their pockets.  Of course it does have high end packages for those who require a vip service. So it is a buffet of different packages. We had decided to spend time till lunch and then return back to pavilion. But we spent the whole day leaving the place only at 6 o‚Äôclock in the evening. In fact it is a place fit for spending at least two days. There is a lot to see especially for kids and the younger lot. It is a theme park as well as a working film studio. We were told that it was spread over two thousand acres.Action Theater - by far the best piece of the entire place in my opinion. They have cleverly woven audience participation in the show. Volunteers were selected at random from the audience and were asked to ride stationary two-wheelers to enact a scene of robbers chasing on the road. Then they showed the ‚Äòreel life‚Äô transformation of that which really looked like a live chase on a road. They also demonstrated how sound is added to a movie with mundane equipment. Highly entertaining. And gave us terrific insights into movie making.Bird Park was another place that we loved. The park has one of the best collection of birds. The birds looked in really good shape - unlike the usual bored ones in a zoo. The Star Wars 4D experience was also thrilling albeit short. Other star attractions are movie sets of Bhagavatham and Bahubali. The place also boasts a nice bonsai garden. There are several other things which one can visit depending upon one‚Äôs liking, age group, and energy level. If you think you require a leisurely pace, better spread the experience over two days. There are free hop on hop off buses all around. But still it is a not a place for a quick visit of a few hours. Or one can pay higher and go for the guided tour of one (full) day."
nkameswararao,Mar-20,Ramoji Film City,4,Friends,"Classmates with spouses , numbering 40, visited this place for a day. On the whole it is an enjoying experience. A well organised conducted tour right from reception to departure. It is worth spending a day with dear ones. Lot many things are there to see. Whole concept of this city is appreciable. One interesting spot is film Bahubali Settings.One wonders how  the film is finally made looking at the setting created/seen here. One can surely visit this place with friends /families."
sunil,Mar-19,Ramoji Film City,5,Friends,"As the name suggests,it is basically to film makers where u can have replica and sets of any location.One day is not enough to pay the visit to all the places in it and it spans over few hundreds of acres."
swati,Feb-20,Ramoji Film City,4,Friends,"It's been certified by Guinness World Records. Hyderabad's one of the famous tourist places one must visit to. However, avoid in summer.Weather will be too hot to enjoy the place. Place is good for photography as well and there are no extra charges for DSLR up to 18-55mm."
Akillchowdary,Sep-19,Ramoji Film City,5,Friends,"Ramoji Film City is a wonderful place for full day family outing. It leaves all visiters with some memorable experiences. We were much impressed with the visitor friendly approach taken by the management. The young volunteers available all over the property are always ready to attend to all sorts of queries. The shows were unique and keep you enthralled. Total property is well maintained, clean and adequate provision for food, drinking water and rest rooms. Sprawling gardens are beautiful with variety of flora and fauna. We were lucky to attend the winter carnival which was a grand show of music & dance.Overall, it is a must visit place and should not be missed if one goes to Hyderabad.A must go for based on VIP members because it gives extra benefits for tourists.."

Jinesh S,Feb-20,Ramoji Film City,5,,It was a great experience to visit Ramoji Film city. One day would be not enough to visit entire place. However if one has limited time and budget can cover 80 to 90 % if well planned.
siddharth Rawat,Sep-19,Ramoji Film City,5,Friends,It's best to reach here in the morning around 9. The day seems to be short to cover the entire film city. The experience is rich. Must watch being the sound and light show. Ample amount of food joints are available. A day well spent and with rich learning experience.

Maresa G,Jan-20,Ramoji Film City,4,Couples,"This is a worthwhile 1.5 hr roadtrip from the city Centre if you're 1. A big Bollywood fan or 2. You're a child.I am a Bollywood fan but not a fanatic, and found this tour to be worthwhile and quite a pleasant way to spend an afternoon in Hyderbadh.I enjoyed the fact that there is a lot more to do than merely tour a film studio.  Mr Ramoji Rao clearly is an entrepreneur who knows how to bring in the crowds, and this can be a most enjoyable trip for a family with young kids, with the very attractive amusement park, Eureka and Fundustan;  the Ramoji Movie Magic section with its Filmmaking experience, Eyelusion Gallery, Black Light show, Stunt show; as well as a bird park and butterfly garden, and a Japanese and bonsai garden, being just a few of the numerous immaculate gardens dotted around the grounds.We visited now during the last week of the ""Longest Winter Fest"", which ran from 13 Dec and which will end on 26 Jan;  hence the visiting crowds reasonably large, but clearly thinning out at this time, hence thankfully not having to queue for tickets.The bus tours offered between 10am - 5pm are very well organized, allowing one to cover the grounds of the entire film city in pretty much 4 - 5 hours. I thought this was more than enough time, but was rather disappointed that the tour guides only spoke in Hindi, and there was no attempt at all to accommodate us foreigners. Should you want to experience this park fully, one can book a night at one of Ramoji's hotels and then have more than enough time to experience the various carnival shows and dance performances which take place after the park has closed.No doubt, there is a lot to see, do and experience at Ramoji's Wonderland for anyone;  whether you're a Bollywood fan, a local tourist, a child, or merely just a foreigner wanting to see how Ramoji the Magician transformed 1666 Ha of land into the World's Largest Film City! "
Sagar P,Jun-23,Nehru Zoological Park,5,Family,This is really HUGE zoo park . Lot of around 200 different animal species are kept over 350 acre land. Very well maintained .

Saurabh M,Dec-22,Nehru Zoological Park,5,Friends,"Exploring Telangana...... Hyderabad.....at Zoo....Located at a distance of 16 km from Hyderabad, Nehru Zoological Park was opened to the public in the year of 1963. It is situated near the historically important Mir Alam Tank, which is 200 year old and is the first multi-arch masonry dam in the world. Nehru Zoological Park is one of the largest zoos of India . Run by the Forest department, Government of Telangana, the zoo has been named after Jawaharlal Nehru, the first prime minister of the country........What makes Hyderabad zoo an amiable place for both visitors and inhabitants are the open enclosures in which animals are kept. These open enclosures have been created to resemble the natural habitats. A wide variety of exotic animals have been successfully bred in this zoo park as well.There is electric car which is very helpful......"
SPillai,Jan-23,Nehru Zoological Park,3,,A large area with a number of animal and bird varieties. But maintenance and upkeep leaves a lot to be desired. Visitor amenities can also be improved significantly.
OctOriental,Nov-22,Nehru Zoological Park,4,,"The Nehru Zoological Park could be better organised. Outside the main gate it is a bit too chaotic and noisy and dusty with broken roads but that's Hyderabad. The zoo could have done with more logical signposts to different enclosures so that we don't miss a single creature. The safari rides last 15 minutes but give you a good look at lions, tigers, bisons. Lots of schoolkids on their school-organised visits lend to the nice feel of the place. Most commonly known wild animals are here. Must visit."
Global-Bhatakanti,Nov-22,Nehru Zoological Park,4,Family,"Suggested time: Min 2 hours to max 5 hours.You can buy some basic snack and food items inside zoo. There are battery vehicles with ‚Çπ100 per person charge, but not of much use as you have to get down at every halt whether or not you want to. Also on weekends there is long queue for ticket and battery vehicle."

Gurus49,Feb-22,Nehru Zoological Park,5,,One cannot believe such a place can exist within a city. It is nicely laid out and the animals seem to be in their natural environment. 
Mitalee2012,Dec-21,Nehru Zoological Park,4,,"Got to see the whole gamut of wild animals enjoying the winter sun. It's best to go early (at 8:30-9am) when the animals are up and about as they tend to retire for the afternoon.Specially enjoyed the nocturnal animal den and snake pits. TPro tip: if you want to enjoy the Safari, take the hop-on/hop-off tickets and get down at the Safari stop (3rd stop after the elephant stop), as it is a LONG walk and difficult to get back to, especially with children. The toy train was also pleasant and enjoyable."
Deepali G,Sep-20,Nehru Zoological Park,4,,good zoo..well maintained..try to take food on your own..there are lots of varieties...cycling is also available..but try to go early ..
Mainak_Choudhuri,Mar-21,Nehru Zoological Park,3,,"This was my second time visit to the zoo to show my kid. Found that the safaris as well as the Reptile House and Nocturnal Animal house are closed. Got disappointed a bit.They have a cheetah exhibit, a large deer and emu exhibit, and a large elephant exhibit. Other animals worth note are lion, tiger, white tiger, wolf, fox, jackal, gaur, hippo, rhino, ostrich, two types of bear, giraffe, sambar, blackbuck, white deer and crocodiles. There are some walk in aviaries, but entry now restricted due to Covid situation. Did not see any large apes, but seen a few small monkeys. All animals are kept in natural settings, though sometimes a little small.There are battery cars which are hop-on hop-off types, excellent to traverse the zoo, though still it takes much walking. The toy train starts only after a minimum number of passengers. It is possible to walk the entire length, there is a major circular path and small inner walkways.There is a refundable Rs. 10 per bottle  deposit to take plastic bottles inside."

NAZEER SHAIK,Mar-20,Nehru Zoological Park,5,,Nehru zoological park was one of the most popular visiting places in Hyderabad/Telangana. Nice place to visit
Lesley,Mar-20,Nehru Zoological Park,3,Friends,"Entry ticket with 60Rs per head. You can find animals like white tiger, tiger, lion, elephants, hippopotamus, rhinoceros and many wild animals. There's a highly priced canteen inside selling chat items and briyani. Have 3-4 water bottles during your visit. By the time we visited, safari ride was not there, which would take you inside the forest with freely roaming animals. Worth to go if you are going as a family with children as they would enjoy the park and the animals. For a gang of friends, you would start feeling devastated by this visit."

But the safari visit inside the park was fantastic. Young and old, all will enjoy it. The deer enclosures, the birds and the butterfly park is amazing     Need to have some more well fed animals in the park. I admire the staff for their love and caring nature towards these animals."
Krishna Sandeep Siram,Sep-19,Nehru Zoological Park,4,,This place is Good but too expensive and mostly you will see deers and some rare species of different animals.For Lion and Tiger you have to take another Safari ride in Bus.
wjw2018,Jan-20,Nehru Zoological Park,4,Solo,"Once you get past the 'no plastics' security patrol, who will confiscate any plastic bags or make you get your water bottle stamped for a 10 Rs deposit, you're free to enter this zoo (tickets cost 50 Rs)...and WHAT a huge zoo it is! There are not a massive amount of animals but the ones that are there looked to be in a reasonable condition and had food and water, though the cages for the birds didn't have any greenery in them which was sad. For those who don't like walking too much, there are various transport options like a train and some small golf cart trailers who'll take you around  for a small charge. Also, halfway round the zoo there's a bus that you can board, for an extra 50 Rs, to take you on a mini 'safari' where you can see lions, a tiger and some bears. I was saddened to see them in cages though....the area of the safari would be big enough for them to roam free, but they've been contained in featureless enclosures which is sad. Outside of this, there's a lot of imagination shown, with tunnels and fossil parks and all sorts. It does make for a good day out, but there could be some improvement with more seating and some restaurants and water points. Overall, pretty good, though a bit more foliage in the bird cages would be kinder for them, plus more staff presence to stop people whistling and harassing the animals is definitely needed."

Arun Karthik,Dec-18,Nehru Zoological Park,5,,"Also called as Hyderabad Zoo, Nehru Zoological Park was established in the year 1959 but it was only in 1963 when it got opened for public. A must-visit for animal lovers, this zoo houses around 250 species of fauna. All the animals are kept in surroundings similar to their natural atmosphere. Spanning across an area of 300 acres, it has species of Indian rhino, Bengal tiger, Indian elephant, python, panther, Asiatic lion, gaur, antelopes, deer, Himalayan Black Bear and number of birds as its inmates. A number of animals from zoo across the country have been brought here showcasing the variety of wildlife it inhabitants.Few added attractions for children and visitors include Natural History Museum, Toy Train, Aquarium, Butterfly Park, Jurassic Park, and Children‚Äôs Park. It happens to be the first zoo that started off with the idea of Safari Park and successfully established the Lion Safari Park. This park has been extended to a Safari complex also including Bear Safari, Tiger Safari, and Bison Safari. Proper eating amenities are provided for visitors including a multi-cuisine food court, canteen,dairy parlour and bakery.Moreover, Mir Alam Tank that is situated next to this zoological park draws a number of people due to boating activity conducted by the Andhra Pradesh Tourism Department."

RaviPoojari,Feb-19,Nehru Zoological Park,4,,Good place to visit and see animals. You can see different animals but looks park dont have good resturants inside to eat something good.

Overall it's a great place and takes 4-5 hours to cover on weekends, located close to city. The park is well maintained with toy train, battery operated hop on cars, and ample animals to see especially if you have kids with you or if you are first timer. However inadequate signages make you  walk a lot, stand in slow and unorganized ques etc. The safari is a total time waste considering tigers are caged. Food options are too limited, better to carry own food. Do visit as a tick in box if you stay at Hyderabad"
Kalilur R,Jun-19,Nehru Zoological Park,3,Family,"The park is situated amist the middle of populated town. Thought it is a very old zoo in Hyderabad, the developements are lacking. Animals are very far away and seeing them is seems difficult. In safari very little wild animals."

Muneer,Dec-18,Nehru Zoological Park,3,Family,Hi nehru zoological park is a very beautiful park to meet a wildlife closely and know about nature I and my family enjoy this trip üëçüèªüêÖüêÜü¶íüêòü¶çü¶Éüêáüêäü¶å
Manideep Vavila,Jan-19,Nehru Zoological Park,5,Friends,Fully enjoyed all kinds of animals are there it felt like a journey going through forest. We enjoyed a lot in safari drive
Prashanth,Jul-19,Nehru Zoological Park,3,Family,It was a good visit to the Zoo. My son loved and we could spot most of the animals. He had a great time. Now coming to the bad parts of the visit - We went on Sunday which is the most busy day for the park.So as expected it was very crowded. We wanted to rent a personal cart but after standing in the line for 1 hour I was told they dont have any available I have to do the sharing cart. But they gave a personal cart to the guy who did not even stand in the line as he had a connection with some hid ranked departments. The guys driving the carts had such an arrogant attitude that most of the people riding it could feel it and had lot of altercations with them.Other than that we had a great visit and could show so many animals to my son. 
abrahamsuji,Jul-19,Nehru Zoological Park,5,Family,Easy access from city. Enjoyed the visit. Well maintained premises. Can opt for hop on hop off buggy ride to reduce walking. Kids will love the experience
Qkahmed,Jul-19,Nehru Zoological Park,5,Family,The Nehru Zoological Park is the second largest animal and birds park stretched across several square kilometers. The zoo houses all animals and birds from India and overseas. The zoo is famous for its white tiger and lion safari park. It also has an animal and bird museum. A great place for tourist and children to watch almost all species of animals and birds.
preethi d,Jul-19,Nehru Zoological Park,1,Family,"The zoo opens at 8:30am and the staff comes at 10am that means all the animals will be inside the night shelters and nothing to see,  they should either shift the opening timings to 10am or the staff should come to the zoo an hour earlier than the open timings clean the zoo, animals and open all the enclosures. Worst maintenance."
Rahul S,Jul-19,Nehru Zoological Park,5,Couples,"I really liked the place and the structure of all the placed there, There you will find various types of all kinds of species.....Great to spend a Day"
Ravindra V,Jun-19,Nehru Zoological Park,5,Family,"It is one of the largest and top zoos in India. There are many exhibits inside the park. Some of the famous ones are reptiles, nocturnal animals, turtles etc. There is Lion Safari but it will be very crowded. Instead try the toy train. There is good variety of wild animals and birds. Plastic is not allowed but your own is allowed. Bring your food in steel containers so that you do not face any problem at the entrance. All those items which are not allowed can be kept in locker."
amitdon2,Jun-19,Nehru Zoological Park,4,Family,The zoo is very big and inside they have electric cars which they charge for each person 50rs.its very tiring to walk so better to take an electric car or we can take personal electric car which they charge 2000rs for 120 mins which will be with us through out and capacity is for 10persons.
Farhan M,May-18,Nehru Zoological Park,5,,Nehru zoological park is very well maintained you will get each and every animal there specially the safari park is really nice

HONEY,May-19,Nehru Zoological Park,4,Solo,I visit this zoo park .It was quite good.I had grate time spend here.Fully enjoyed.I recommend this place for turistor.
krajeevc,May-19,Nehru Zoological Park,5,Family,"This zoo is one of the best in India.You have buggy services to drop/hop you to 5 points each of which covers a significant portion of zoo.There is a seperate lion safari bus ride and a train  ride.The rest rooms are not up to the mark and need to be upgraded. Food / Canteen facilities are good and reasonably priced. One needs to spend 4-5 hrs at least to cover the entire zoo.If you do not want to explore on foot and get overly tiered, use the buggy service or rental cycles. Keep hydrated throughout. This Zoo is worth visiting."
Adeeb unisa,Mar-19,Nehru Zoological Park,3,Family,I feel theres scope for cleanliness and maintainence. And go ahead with children.have fun.treat animals well.
Nagesh Eco Ventures,Oct-18,Nehru Zoological Park,4,Family,Awesome place to see all the wild animals in one place... Paisa Vasool... especially for children of all ages.
pvrkaushik,Jan-19,Nehru Zoological Park,4,Family,Its good place to take kids especially... Lion's den is the best. And hippo my favourite.. Little far from city centre... Take plenty water... Keep urself hydrated
TravelEnthusiast,Apr-19,Nehru Zoological Park,5,Family,"The trip to Nehru Zoological Park is amzing especially when you go with your friends, family and loved ones. You can reach out to here in public transport or Ola / Uber or any other cab. Its a nice zoo park perfectly maintained and organized. It has way boards, maps and directions. You can also take bycicles and buggies. You can take any of them based on your requirement. You can enjoy the trip with so much ease. This saves lot of time, effort and energy.You will find lot of people from Andhra, Telangana and many other states too. The best way I found is to take a ticket at the entrance for buggy. You will enjoy the trip. There are good canteens also in the zoo park. You can buy popcorn üçø, Samosa and ice creams. There are many animals that you will find interesting and curios to know the facts if you carefully read about them.Overall its a nice place to enjoy the trip."
NIL_MODI,Mar-19,Nehru Zoological Park,4,Family,"Superb Place. Must attend. Huge collections of animals birds, insect , reptiles etc...One should be ready to get tired if want to explore on feet. Big round enough to make you tired. keep drinking water and energy drink. Enough greenery to protect you from sunlight. They also provide electric car service on charge basis which will show the whole park. give enough intervals at fixed points to explore the life of animals. best option for who wants to round the park without getting tired."
Peter V,Apr-19,Nehru Zoological Park,4,Solo,"I had a free Sunday in Hyderabad and decided to visit the Zoo. I was pleasantly surprised by the space the animals have: I saw some beautiful albino tigers, elephants, giraffes, tropical birds, etc... What I did not know is that I was going to be the only tourist (ie. white male) in the entire Zoo; so I became the attraction. Families with kids wanted to take pictures with me which was somewhat unexpected. Oh and the other funny thing about my visit is that the most popular animals in the Zoo were the deer! I was barely interested, but the locals were all lining up to see deer."
Abhilash K,Apr-19,Nehru Zoological Park,4,Friends,This is one of the big zoos in India. There are lot of species available here. You can visit here and enjoy with your kids.
Dr I R Patil,Apr-19,Nehru Zoological Park,5,Family,"Nice place it's huge kindly opt for battery operated vehicle if you don't have much time it will close at 5.30 pm evening, most of animals goes inside the cave by 4.30 pm. By walk it takes around 3 hours with battery vehicle around 90 min. Best part is they have most of animals tiger, Lion, elephants, white tiger, hippopotamus, peacock, deer, fox, Hynes, ostrich, cheetah children's will enjoy."
sophiarnd,Oct-18,Nehru Zoological Park,4,Friends,As there are lots of trees and the zoo holds a huge area we went for birding. Have to reach early but the zoo isn‚Äôt open then so have to just do with late morning birds high up in the big trees. Good place to visit
GoWrong,May-18,Nehru Zoological Park,5,Family,"The thing which impresses you the most about this place is upkeep and maintenance. The confines of all the animals are nicely fenced and quite clean. There are variety of big cats, there is a butterfly park, there are giraffes. Its quite a fun way of watching wild animals."
Soumyajit Saha,Jul-18,Nehru Zoological Park,4,Solo,Nehru Zoological Garden is the Zoo of Hyderabad. It is very large and spanning in many acres. People must visit this place with family and children. There is a nominal charge per member. One can come to this place taking any public transport from the city.
Mukta2016,Jan-19,Nehru Zoological Park,4,Family,The Nehru Zoological in Hyderabad is a very well maintained zoo and has a lot of wild animals in very nice and spacious enclosures. There is also a toy train ride inside the zoo which will be enjoyed by the kids.
sree143in,Feb-19,Nehru Zoological Park,4,Solo,"in This park we can see a lot animals like lion, tiger, elephant, and many more. a lot different birds also here."
Dilip kumar,Jan-19,Nehru Zoological Park,4,Friends,This place will give you good pleasant nature and also involves in getting the good healthy fresh mind.
Milind Kshirsagar,Feb-19,Nehru Zoological Park,5,Family,"A wide range of birds and animals including Lions, hippos, rhinos, tigers, giraffe, crocks, snakes. It's a very large zoo. Hire battery operated vehicle if you want to preserve your energy for other places."
nik c,Feb-19,Nehru Zoological Park,4,Couples,"Nehru Zoological Park is a very pleasant place to spend a day.   The park is well laid out with easy access to the exhibits.    The gardens are well maintained and there is a train ride for the kids (even the grown up kids).   There is a safari park ""tour"" and a ""Natural History Museum"" at the park, but I wouldn't bother with either of these as they were both VERY disappointing.   Overall it was a very nice visit and you could easily spend a day there."
Rakesh,Nov-18,Nehru Zoological Park,4,Business,"Dont Rush your day by planning half day zoo tour, I suggest anyone to allocate whole day here. if possible, one routine suggestion i would like to give here, Plan it on weekdays (except on closing day- Monday i guess), because when we went there on Sunday, its totally Crowd, and you may not like it, people bring mats and water cans then eat food on lawns.if you are a pack of 10 or so, then you can book a resting room or retiring room also, you can google for that info.Coming to imp part, never miss lions, tigers and lot of animals like giraffe, also white tigers.Most importantly follow the path guided by them, because you may end of moving in the zoo walking extra without watching all animals. Zoo is very very bigHave fun. Enjoy your trip"
Ashish S,Feb-19,Nehru Zoological Park,5,Business,This park was Excellent and was very well maintained. This park was very organized and neat. It was also not very busy.
P V NEELAKANTA R,Nov-18,Nehru Zoological Park,5,,it is a nice place to visit with family and friends on weekend .you can spend time at leisure here on weekends
Suresh1976,Dec-18,Nehru Zoological Park,5,,"We had visited this place in Dec. we had a wonderful time in this zoo and my kids enjoyed a lot. This zoo is very big, has lot of animals and different types of birds, reptiles, small fish aquarium.Animals like Cheetah, leopard, tiger, wolf, jackal, hyena, elephants, giraffe, ostrich, we found lots of deer. They have kept different types of birds, peacocks etc. in reptiles we have seen some crocodiles and different types of snakes.It is nicely maintained and it is very clean. Before the entrance there is the proper checking where staff don‚Äôt allow anyone to carry plastic bags inside the zoo. After the entrance you will find a mini van service which is quite good if you have old age people with you or if your kids are very small who cannot walk long distance. Zoo is spread in the vast area where you need to walk a long distance to cover all the animals.After the entrance there is toy train also. Ticket is very reasonable. Rs 20 for adult and Rs.10 for child. I advise you to take this toy train, kids will enjoy a lot. It covers the complete zoo area in 25 mins.There is Safari service also but we skipped it because of lot of rush. So better go early so that you don‚Äôt miss this safari service.You will not find much eateries inside. You will find ample drinking water and public toilets inside the zoo at various places.You will require full day to enjoy complete zoo but we spent 4 hours and skipped some of the places.We had a wonderful time in this zoo."
Mandar Jetly,Dec-18,Nehru Zoological Park,4,Family,Wide variety of animals - Safari took more time in queue - go for AC bus if you have money as there was no queue - Reach early - you can miss Aquarium - There should be more supervision in area of Nocturnal animal & snake encounters as Peaple make crowd and push each other.Overall worth visit if you like animals.If you are strong and young do not take battery operated vehicle.
manikantaa,Jan-19,Nehru Zoological Park,4,Friends,Very lot of people are there in this zoo park I very enjoyable in this so many of animals are there good tq
vinodkhedkar,Nov-18,Nehru Zoological Park,4,Family,"This is the perhaps best zoo in India. Situated in Hyderabad city, this is a must see place. We had a wonderful time especially my kid enjoyed this place. Spread across the acres of land this zoo inhibits various types of bird,reptiles and animals.This is a journey to the jungle.Staff is prompt and cleanliness in maintained. Lion safari is a highlight of this zoo. You need an entire day to see this place and enjoy it thoroughly. Definitely visiting this place again during next visit to Hyderabad."
Dr. Santosh Raut,Jan-19,Nehru Zoological Park,5,Family,"One of the good park in Hyderabad, wide area spread in lot of area, having facility of battery operated cars with reasonable price, cleanliness is good as compared to other govt parks"
anonymous8808,Jan-19,Nehru Zoological Park,3,Family,pro1. big zoo2. kid enjoy itcons:1. toilet very smelly can smell it from walkway2. animal is not that many. like for elephant only saw 3 and girraffe only 13. no baby room
explorer india,Dec-18,Nehru Zoological Park,4,Family,"Its a big zoo housing lot of Indian, Asian  and African species of animals in big enclosures including Indian Lions , African Lion , Indian tiger , White Tiger , Cheetah , Leopard, Hippo , Rhino , Elephant , Jirrafe , Crocodile etc... Its a huge trail walking , so one can hire bicycle inside or take a battery cart hop on hop off ride for extra cost. The zoo overall is not that hygenic and the animal enclsures often smell foul. So be sure to carry your hand sanitiser also. Overall the children enjoy seeing so many animals at one place but the place reaaly needs to be better maintained."
Baburajnair,Jan-19,Nehru Zoological Park,5,Family,Could find some rare animals here. Well maintained. Bit crowded during holidays. Better to visit during winter. Can spend a day easily here. Safari is also there. Galapagose tortoise is a main attraction. 
Sandeep Bhojani,Dec-18,Nehru Zoological Park,3,Family,"The authorities are good in terms of maintaining things but we had been on a sunday that too in christmas vacation, so it was very crowded. It is difficult to find few locations of the animals although you can see them in them in the Map on the main road. As when you move inside from the main road there are very few guiding maps who would suggest you the way. Toilets are pay and use and there is additional fee for aquarium, noctrunal animals, fossil mueseum etc. A good place to visit but avoid on public holidays and summer hot days as need to walk a lot if u want to explore all the animals, as the electric car and the mini train would not offer you sights of important animals like lion, tiger etc"
Murali M,Dec-18,Nehru Zoological Park,3,Family,"We went to Zoo on Christmas day 2018 and as expected it got crowded as the day progressed. We reached there early and good thing we did, as we didn't have to wait for battery car or train or long queue at entrance. Few changes from last time I visited.1. They used to allow our own vehicles inside, Now you have to park and remember to reach early if you are going on a public holiday or weekend.2. No plastic allowed inside. Any plates, covers, bags are strictly prohibited. 3. Best time to reach there is 9:00 AM. 4. Don't expect much in safari. There is nothing to it and I recommend you skip it unless you hear of any improvements/changes.5. Vast area so be prepared to walk even though you have rented battery car, they operate from point to point but you still need to walk around quite a bit.Overall, I feel neatness has improved with plastic and vehicle ban, having said that what this zoo needs is more animals :-) Hope they can bring in more attractions as it has potential to go long way."
Chetu1087,Apr-18,Nehru Zoological Park,4,,"It was good experience to visit such a big zoo after so long time. Area wise it was really a big zoo park but facilities can be improved like eateries, snack store etc. Cleanliness was good enough. "
aap,Dec-18,Nehru Zoological Park,3,Family,Firstly I would say instead of animals I could only see grasses and trees everywhere..Half of the cages were empty before I visted hyd zoo I had visited Chennai wonderloo zoo and it was worth to see...could see each and every animal in a proper way..Kids were highly disappointed..we come all the way and don't find any animals in a proper way..Birds was the only thing which was worth to watch ..The famous white tiger was not even seen only 1 and they have made it so huge and grasses all around that we had to lift our children's and peep through it.Govt need to work out for the zoo ..and high maintenance is required...
Sagar D,Nov-18,Nehru Zoological Park,2,Family,We went there with so much expections but it wasn't worth of it... Though the entry charge is less u have to pay separately for Battery vehicle  & Safari ride...Jungle Safari is useless..All the animals are in cage only so not sure why they called it Safari..Not mainatned properly when compared to Benglore Zoo..
Sana B,Dec-18,Nehru Zoological Park,5,Friends,I luv this place very mch as you can find so many kind of animals and birds there. It is good if you go with friends and it is having food and drinks too. The white tiger is quiet famous there and as well ypu can take a cycle on rent to explore and as well there is an open car which will take you to tour the zoo for those who dont wanna walk along with that there is a train in the zoo which give you the close look with the animals and its pocket friendly too.
ravishtandon,Jan-18,Nehru Zoological Park,5,,You can see open safari at Hyderabad Zoo. The zoo is spread in a very vast area and a good place to visit with family. Toy train and open elephants are another attraction.
SoloMTraveler,Jun-18,Nehru Zoological Park,5,Family,"The biggest Park in Hyderabad. Hundreds of animals, birds, species that you can have a look. Normally weekends are busy. Recommended on weekdays."
Shridhar93,Nov-18,Nehru Zoological Park,5,Family,"There are about 1200 animals and 100 different species in Nehru Zoological Park . Various Animals, birds and reptiles are present in this zoo. Species like tigers, Lions, Chimpanzees, Panthers, white peacocks and many more Must Visit"
Udmaam,Dec-18,Nehru Zoological Park,3,Family,Never go to this place on weekends.. crowd management with regard to battery cars in worst. No one keeps a check at the battery car halts and whoever pushes gets in. Whoever is waiting will wait for ages. Other things are good. Its not easy to get tickets for safari. You have to wait in the queue for at least an hour on weekends. Can have refreshment corners at more number of places. Other things are fine.
Trending T,Oct-18,Nehru Zoological Park,4,Friends,this place has got wide variety of animal life and its the best place in hyderabd from almost 30 years.
Ashwin J,Nov-18,Nehru Zoological Park,3,Family,"Have been wanting to visit this place since the time i came to Hyderabad.... The place is easy to locate following Google maps...Reached around 12pm and it was extremely crowded... Parking was a big hassle and finally they asked to park in a spot...Went inside and saw a long queue for the shuttle... Decided to go for the toy train... Apparently the toy trains were booked until 4'30 by some school... So they were asking us to wait for 4hrs to board a toy train... Hopeless management of logistics...The shuttle was managed equally bad... People just jump the queue and get into the bus... No consideration given to parents with little kids or elderly people... Management needs to come up with a smarter way to handle the crowd... I have been to zoos inside and outside India... Never faced this problem.... Coming to animals and birds... No animals were active... Most of them were hiding inside their shelter... Many shelters had only 1 animal. I have always seen at least 2 animals in one shelter... But here, there was only 1 tiger, 1 jaguar, 1 giraffe etc... No companionship for the animals... Nothing was great that made the experience a wow experience... Normal zoo just hyped because of low entry fee... The safari again had waiting time of 3hrs.... The lack of planning by authorities was evident everywhere.... Two layers of cars and bikes were parked behind our car... Struggled for minimum 1hr to take the car.... Will not suggest this place... You can take the risk of visiting this place but don't drive and be ready to wait and wait and wait"
Reon Sylvester,Nov-18,Nehru Zoological Park,5,Friends,"It is a huge zoo spread over hundreds of acres. It has variety of colourful birds, Reptiles and other animals. White tiger is the most attractive one. And also few bears.One can rent a bicycle(individual) or electric vehicle( for a group of people) to cover the entire zoo by paying prescribed Fee. There are many shops as well. Overall, this zoo is amazing ‚ù§Ô∏è"
Devaa,Jan-18,Nehru Zoological Park,4,Friends,Its a huge zoo almost in the the heart of the city. There is nothing extraordinary here common animals which you see in any other zoo in India is what they have here. Its high time the zoo management should go abroad nearby Singapore zoo which must be less then half the size of this zoo and learn new techniques and vision to install this birds an animal in more attractive way .
vikram a,Nov-18,Nehru Zoological Park,3,Family,difficult to travel with kids the area of the zoo is big to cover all animals no food inside the park
Suhail Siddqui,Nov-18,Nehru Zoological Park,5,Family,"A full family place to get up and close with wild and reptiles. White tiger, lions,  leopards, elephants, crocs, snakes, chameleons, owls, giraffe etc.Please do make notice of following point which will help you if you visit over there:1. Entry tickets are just to make entry in zoo.2. If you want to travel on battery car at important point where you can see animals then it ticket you will get inside. (WOULD STRONGLY recommend this as there are lots of waling) or you can opt for bicycle on rent for each individual.3. If you want to take safari which is separate from zoo then, you have buy tickets inside, they will take inside the restricted zone where lions are roaming free (we saw just one).4. If you want to see OWLS, then you have shell 20 INR per head inside zoo. This place is right after reptile section.Overall an amazing place."
Vidyadheesh U,Jan-18,Nehru Zoological Park,5,Family,"Nehru Zoological Park is spread over 380 acres of land. It houses about 155 species of animals, birds and reptiles. It was opened to general public in the year 1963. It is one of the largest zoos in India and a major tourist attraction in Hyderabad.They sheer size of the park makes it a half day or a full day activity. There are battery operated vehicles inside the park for conveyance but most of the park has to be still covered on foot. It is better to be equipped with caps, hats or scarves to protect yourself from the harsh sun. It is a plastic free zone hence you need to make arrangement to carry water for children accompanying you, if any. What makes this Zoo more endearing is that the animals have kept in an open enclosure, however due care has been taken vis-√†-vis the safety aspect for animals as well as visitors. The open enclosure is close to their natural habitat though not entirely replicated. The animals are stationed under the following zones:  Primate Park ‚Äì Monkeys, Baboon, Chimpanzee etcCarnivore Plaza ‚Äì Tiger, Hyena, Wild Dogs, Jackal, Fox, JaguarLion Junction ‚Äì Lions, Leopard, Rhinoceros, Hippopotamus Bears Bay ‚Äì Indian Sloth Bear, Malayan Sun Bear, various birdsDeer Land ‚Äì Gaur, Antelope, Black Buck & NilgaiReptile Row ‚Äì Various types of reptiles like snakes, tortoise, iguana, crocodile.Parrot World ‚Äì Parrots, Parakeet, Macaw, Nocturnal Animal World ‚Äì Owls, Porcupine, LorisElephant Odyssey ‚Äì Elephant, PeafowlThe place is kept clean and hygienic. It must be taking a lot of effort on the part of the staff to maintain the levels of cleanliness.Entry fee is very nominal and they charge you separately for photography, videography etc.My daughter got her live introduction to wild animals here and now she just adores them."
rsraghavan6,Jan-18,Nehru Zoological Park,5,Business,"Very good place. It's a zoo you can enjoy. I mean all types of animals! Amazing place to visit. The location set for animals is also picturesque. I mean the lake is really good. If planning to go With your children, it's the place you should go for! Don't see the ticket rates. It may seem a little more at beginning but as you start watching the zoo, you will not care. Enjoy the fullest. And yes take your time. It would take time to watch it perfectly. Dedicate one whole day to it!"

lovetravelonly,Aug 2017,Birla Science Museum,4.0,Family,"Objects related to history, science, space and dinosaurs are found here. Idols made before 1000 years are also found here. The most unique part is the history section. Historical lovers will love it to visit."
TTDh,Aug 2017,Birla Science Museum,3.0,Family,"When we visited, the place was undergoing some renovation.There are several exhibits around mechanics/energy/space themes. There also is a museum with several collectibles like carpets and crystals and procaeline items.The main attraction hear though is the fossils and the place has a exhibit of a full dinosaur. The exhibits hear give a good idea of what is found in India.If you have a school going kid, worth a visit, will need 3 hours."
avenkat2016,Oct 2017,Birla Science Museum,5.0,Family,"even with limited resources, they have managed to put together a nice collection of experiments and phenomena for kids to understand and explore. great for kids under 13, who are into science. the degree of hands on interaction ensures kids learn and enjoy science more, rather than having fancy things behind glass cases."

BhautikVVaidya,Jun 2017,Birla Science Museum,5.0,Family,"This science center is one of its kind. It has objects related to history, science, space and dinosaurs. The trip is definitely worth the money. The most unique part is the history section in which there are idols that are older than 1000 years! The ground floor had many experiments, which show the workings of scientific principles in a practical sense. The 1st floor had models of the part of Antarctica which is controlled by India and had the model of the sunken city of Dwarka (very informative). The 2nd level had the bones and information on Dinosaurs and other animals that lived with the dinosaurs. The museum has a lot to show and see so it could be completed in about 3 hours. We have visited many Science Museums, and we can surely say that the history and Dinosaur section is better than those at most places."
ramchabi,Jul 2017,Birla Science Museum,4.0,Family,With kids this is a great place to visit. Kids can do hands on experience. The icing is dinosaur skeleton. If u have kids go here for sure.

MrH0rnet,Jun 2017,Birla Science Museum,5.0,Friends,"This place has 5 sub category to visit1. Planetarium: Amazing experience , specially for students and science enthusiast. Well explanation and 360¬∞ screen are like you are sitting under clear sky. Though , I felt explanation can be made little easier fir understanding of school children.2. 3D movie about solar and space facts:Great for young school children knowing already and having watched many 3 movies it felt boating. 3. Art Galary : perhaps biggest one I hva visited so far. Spread on 3 floors, most people just visit modern art Galary and miss the best part. In front of art Galary there is huge series of art, Specially we liked painting by Iqbal Hussain on Indian Mythology and history . Amazing details. I wish I could take photos but it wasn't allowed.4.Dianasorium: Huge skeleton of Dianasour found near Hyderabad and information are gear. Touching 200 million old fossil is just a great experience.5.Science Museum with live experiments: this is just a unique experience of day to day life physics. Huge learning for any student. There is IEEE experiments to hands on too. This must for any student to visit.Overall, in 200 per head, this is most fun place in Hyderabad so far."
Varun Pursnani,May 2017,Birla Science Museum,4.0,Friends,"My cousin and I came here for a short visit as we were late for planetarium and surprisingly it was so good from inside that we continued our tour for a much longer time.For science, mathematics, astronomy etc. different different topics each concept was explained very nicely and creatively.Overall it was a very enjoyable and worth our time!!"

CaptainBasu,Mar 2017,Birla Science Museum,3.0,Family,"The place is a storehouse of some greatly intriguing science objects. However, it is very poorly maintained. The planetarium is small but the explanations were clear. Remember to bring lots of water on a summer day. Though not too big, you will need to walk up and down a number of stairs.Suggest climb right up to the planetarium first (shows in English starts at 1130) walking your way down thru the galleries on different levels to reach the science museum at the ground level. There is a separate ticket for the Planetarium which includes the 3D show, and separate ones for the rest of the place. The entry prices kept changing based on God knows what. It was RS.60 on Monday when we arrived, but came up to RS.80 by Wednesday when we actually visited.The science section needs serious maintenance, many gizmos are either inoperative or totally absent.  The Planetarium offers some interesting shows along with the 3D theatre of the seven wonders of Solar system. Expect to spend three hours at leisure."
Memoirs-Sachin,Jan 2017,Birla Science Museum,4.0,Couples,"The Birla Science museum is a collection of artifacts, models & memorabilia. The tour is very informative. The exhibits are spread across 4 floors & takes about 1-2 hours to visit. It is located very close to the Birla Mandir & can be clubbed in a single visit."
Dipubose,Mar 2017,Birla Science Museum,4.0,Family,"Generally missed by most but is a great day activity especially if you have little adults< age less 14 years.It is over 4 floors ,each having different themes- Science(real interactive exhibits around various science principles which kids can have hands on & they will enjoy),Dinosaureum level 4 & lower level with archeological stuff & level 3 as science & space history.Star attraction is Actual dinosuar skeletal exhibit recovered from AP .Entry fee is 80 / head but you can combine this with Birla  Planetorium for 150 combo ticket.you could probably spend 2-3 hours here & ample parking is availalble at campus."
bharadwaj8008,Jan 2017,Birla Science Museum,5.0,Family,"This is one of the finest places at Hyderabad this is a Hindu worship temple, but attracts all sorts of communities and tourist. One can see whole Hyderabad from Top of this Mandir nice location."

itspriyanka,Jan 2017,Birla Science Museum,4.0,Family,"We went on a weekday when school kids were there for picnic. The experiments were good. Our 6 yr old son enjoyed the ones he understood. Some of them were for older kids. Some machines were not working. The dinasorium was good too, with real fossils / bones and real skeleton. We did not visit the doll museum and anthropology section though...And if you are visiting around lunch and do not have your own vehicle, make sure you pack some lunch. Food is allowed inside the museum. There are only some small shacks outside which serve snacks."

rosemaryJobin,Dec 2016,Birla Science Museum,3.0,Family,"Good place to take your kids for a visit, They can learn science through experiments. Better suited for kids above 10 year. Kids will also enjoy the Dinosaurium.  It is very crowded during weekends and holidays. I have visited the science center multiple times during the last 10 years - The observation from the recent visit is - the maintanence is bad, many of the interactive instruments do not work, but the ticket price has gone up considerably. It is 80 per head now and if you combine Planetarium and 3D universe, it is 150 per head."
BRKanth,Oct 2016,Birla Science Museum,4.0,Business,"If anyone want to learn science with real / live experiment, should visit this place. Especially crowded during holidays. "

RkRoadie,Nov 2016,Birla Science Museum,4.0,Family,"Birla Science Centre is one time visit place in Hyderabad tour if you are accompained with kids. The way to science centre goes through steep slopes with lot of jaywalkers on it as the same road goes to Birla Temple as well. Parking  charges are Rs. 30 for 4 hours. Combined ticket rate is Rs. 75 / head (includes entrance, Room Royale, Dolls & Archaelogy Gallery, Interactive Science Section, Dwarka, Antartica, NRSA, IEEE, Dinosaurium) and again Rs.75/head (includes Planetarium, 3D Universe). Camera is Free. But need to deposit in locker while entering Room RoyaleDinosaurium is having huge skelton of Dinosaur which kids will definitely enjoy.

There are no fans/ac inside so feels quite stuffy - pls the light is also less.  Local junta comes a lot because ticket pricess are low. Dinasorium is a waste. ..they should have some working moveing models. "
Amazing_Neo,Sep 2016,Birla Science Museum,5.0,Family,Great collection of science articles and interactive demos that allure young and old.

Not at all recommended!"
SSSUUUNNNNNNYYY,May 2016,Birla Science Museum,5.0,,Birla science centre is a good place to visit with family and kids. It also has 3D theater here. Birla mandir is also very adjacenet.
lonetraveler1,May 2016,Birla Science Museum,4.0,Family,"This place is like a one stop treasure trove for children. The one star that is missing from the rating is for air conditioning. Otherwise, its a perfect place to spend the day with children. They will spend the day discovering, learning, experimenting and watching. At the end of 3 hours, we were still not done. The Nirmala Birla Dolls Museum , then the Archeology museum, where we really saw the grandeur of our past - stone age, iron age, pottery meticulously preserved, terracotta animal figurines that reminded me of Harappa valley pottery figurines.  Then there was Indian painting, Philately, Numismatics, Art. It was 2 hours before the children exited just the basement floor. Then we went to the science experience center, where children play with specially created learning toys. You can easily put kids there for 90 minutes and forget about them. After that it was time for the observatory in the planetarium next door, so off we went. We could see Mars (nothing impressive) and Jupiter(we saw the stripes of Jupiter and the 4 moons of Jupiter). It was awesome! Then we came back to the Dinosaurium. It has a full skeleton of a large dinosaur, one preserved egg fossil, and some bone fossils. Its an awe inspiring skeleton. The building is basic, but that skeleton.. is something!! We missed the space and Antartica Diorama, but we have seen that earlier. MOre than anything else, this visit got me thinking about private museums in the country. This was absolutely fantastic."
Amir Sayeed,Jul 2022,Hussain Sagar Lake,3.0,Family,"It is better to remain away with dirty and stinky lake. The boating is reasonable but in stinky water. One can‚Äôt breathe the fresh air. Avoid it.  Better to drive, pick some ice cream, sit in a car and relax for sometime."

Add to it the horrendous pollution of the city which creates a haze that makes it difficult to see, and you have a truly bad experience. Not worth bothering to even cross the road to see this lake."

There are other types of boat rides like speed boats priced at 350 rupees per boat for 4 people and big cruise boat priced at 100 rupees per person. It was a great experience.

Vikram,Dec 2018,Hussain Sagar Lake,2.0,Family,I had taken my relatives visiting the city to show them the sights around the twin cities. We were unable to stand the stench and the place is very poorly maintained. It also due to poor civic sense of people littering the place.

Chandana Jain,Mar 2019,Hussain Sagar Lake,5.0,Couples,"I have been residing in Hyderabad for the past 26 years and have been to Hussain sagar lake for more than 10 times. Hussain sagar lake is a lake that has a buddha statue which is apparently carved out of a single stone. The statue is beautiful and for seeing the statue you need to take a boat ride either from ""Eat Street"" or from ""Lumbini Park"" there are also private small ships namely bhagmati etc which can be used for a private party, kitty party etc which has a restaurant inside it. These boats also have a live dance performance. The regular boat ticket is priced at 50INR which is adequate. The statue is worth spending it.  The boat ride is amazing and it drops you at buddha statue and gives you 15 minutes to enjoy the beauty of the statue and click pictures. After 15 minutes it takes you back to either ""Eat street"" or ""Lumbini park"" where ever you took the boat from. The experience is worth it for 50 bucks."

The best way to experience lake is to drive around the necklace road and stop by at different designated parking spots; some along the lake side and some across the road, enjoy the view. The giant National flag is something that I didn't see a few years ago! Nice !The speed boat drive on the lake may have some wait, but it's worth it. That's the only way you can get close to the Buddha statue.I wish the authorities do more to keep the lake cleaner, it deserves a better deal.Overall, this is a must see attraction , spend at least an hour.I was there during sunset on a clear sky day, it was beautiful.

Bus No: 5K,5S,5 From Secunderabad to Mehdipatnam any bus no. 113 from Uppal to Mehdipatnam.Birla Mandir is a Hindu temple, built on a 280 feet (85 m) high hillock called Naubath Pahad on a 13 acres (53,000 m2) plot in Hyderabad, Telangana, India. The construction took 10 years and was opened in 1976 by Swami Ranganathananda of Ramakrishna Mission. The temple was constructed by Birla Foundation, which has also constructed several similar temples across India, all of which are known as Birla Mandir....The temple manifests a blend of Dravidian, Rajasthani and Utkala architectures. It is constructed of 2000 tons of pure white marble. The granite idol of presiding deity Lord Venkateswara is about 11 ft (3.4 m) tall and a carved lotus forms an umbrella on the top. There is a brass flagstaff in the temple premises which rises to a height of 42 ft (13 m). The temple does not have traditional bells, as Swami Ranganathananda wished that the temple atmosphere should be conducive for meditation.Apart from the main shrine, the consorts of Lord Venkateswara, Padmavati and Andal are housed in separate shrines. The temple also has separate shrines for various Deva and Devi including Shiva, Shakti, Ganesh, Hanuman, Brahma, Saraswati and Lakshmi.

Sriramramanathan,Dec 2019,Birla mandir,5.0,Family,"This is on the shores of Hussain Sagar, but the approach road is very narrow. This will lead to traffic chokes. Either go @ 7 am or if you go later, alight and walk to avoid delays. All vehicles ( specially cars) cannot turnabout until the temple gate and hence you will always have a backed up traffic to challenge. once you get into the temple , you have to deposit your mobile/ electronics and footwear into its respective lockers/ spaces. The mobile locker line will delay you further if you don‚Äôt go early morning. After this, the pristine beauty of the granite hill top temple will captivate you no bounds. The temple main deity is Venkateswara and you have the related gods and goddesses en route. The view from top, of the necklace road and Hussain Sagar is breathtaking."

No entry fee is required here. No parkling charges, however parking can be an issue as it is residential area.Boating charges are INR 50/- for normal shared boat ride and INR 400/- for Speedboat which can accomodate 6 persons. Each price is for 15 min lake tour.The 2nd entrance is from the park side whose openning time is 5.00am - 8.30am and 4pm - 8pm - Here one have to pay entrance fee of INR 10/- per adult and INR 5/- per child. Parking space available and is free.Lots of contruction and higtises and raods surround the lake which is eye-sore but there are vegetationa nd natural formations at places which are very good to see. We saw few migratory bird species in the lake during our visit.Also a good initiative is to avoid litters, the place do not have any eateries. Toilets , landscped gardens, paved pathways, gym area, childrens pay area are among many facilities taht his place boasts off.A good place for visit with family of young children as well as senior citizens."

Vikram,May 2019,Cable Bridge,3.0,,"I've been to Durgam Cheruvu since late nineties when it was indeed a secret lake with lots of wildlife around. We could see birds, peacocks, snakes and sometime jackals. The path to a great extent was good for a two wheeler and one had to walk. For sometime the Government introduced boats. Concretization has killed the charm with most IT giants and their vehicular traffic & pollution has made it just a small water body.  There is a bridge being built over the lake which will further change the water body.  Visit the lake with an open mind to enjoy a water body in the city to unwind!"
Ravindra V,Jul 2019,Cable Bridge,4.0,Family,It's been renovated recently. Best parts are children's park and open gym. The water stinks at places. Still good place to go for morning or evening walk.

Rajani B,May 2017,Cable Bridge,2.0,Friends,This used to be a beautiful lake adjoining a nice park when I had visited the place some 10 years back. But was really disappointed to see its state now. Lake is very poorly maintained. Lots of thrash on the lake bank. Water of the lake polluted. Authorities need to pay attention to cleanliness.
Partha Sarathi M,Apr 2017,Cable Bridge,2.0,Couples,"I went there on April 01, 2017. No where they mentioned that cameras are not allowed. So  the security guard at ticket counter also didn't check out handbag. So we went inside and started doing our photo session work. The maintenance was too poor. When we were almost done with out photo session, suddenly a security guard inside the park (near the lake) scolded and asked to switch off the camera since its not allowed. I told him no where it's mentioned. So we have to stop our photo session and fall back.It's disgusting and humiliating. What hard a DSLR can do in a park?We will never go there again. It's not good for photography loving people. The management is poor."
None I,Jul 2016,Cable Bridge,2.0,Friends,"Such a great gift of nature to the Hyderabad city and particularly the Madhapur and Gachibowli area but it's a pity that the lake won't live for long.

RiseRichard,Nov 2012,Cable Bridge,1.0,Family,I decided to visit Durgam cheruvu with my parents and family on Sunday. Entry fee of Rs 30 doesnot include boating. Its small park with no place for either walk or sitting and there is no lawn at all. To sum it up its waste of time.. The lake is dead.. The park is destroyed and vandalized. You will come across broken benches and litter every where. If the stench does not make you ill then the cool drinks or snacks will surely make you ill. Out side food is not allowed and you are forced to buy stale food. I would rate it negetive but as 1 is the least possible rating that I can give for this park.. so be it
